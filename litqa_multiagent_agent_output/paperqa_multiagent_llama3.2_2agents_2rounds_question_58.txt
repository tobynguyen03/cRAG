question,"Q: In Arabidopsis, which of the following 20 S proteasome subunits has CWC15 not been shown to interact with in its role promoting degradation of the protein Serrate?"
full_answer,"### Synthesized Answer:

In Arabidopsis, CWC15's role in degrading the protein Serrate is primarily associated with the interaction of one specific 20S proteasome subunit. While both CWC15 interactions with PBE1 and PAG1 are mentioned by experts as not being clearly demonstrated, only PBE1 is explicitly stated (by Agent 0) to lack a shown interaction in this context."
