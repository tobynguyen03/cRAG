question,Q: What is the mechanism for expression of the EPRS1(N1) form of EPRS1 in humans?
full_answer,"The expression of the EPRS1(N1) form of EPRS1 in humans is regulated through post-transcriptional control mechanisms. This process involves novel polyadenylation events and interactions with signaling pathways, such as AKT phosphorylation, to fine-tune the protein's expression."
