question,"Q: When a large excess of membrane protein substrate (Vamp2) is added to the wild-type Get3/4/5 chaperone complex, the complex dissociates into two components. Which component does the substrate bind to?"
full_answer,"Here is a synthesized answer based on the expert inputs:

When a large excess of membrane protein substrate (Vamp2) is added to the wild-type Get3/4/5 chaperone complex, it dissociates into two components. The substrate binds to the Get5 component. This binding interaction is disrupted upon addition of a large amount of Vamp2, causing the complex to split."
