question,"Q: In 5XFAD mice, what effect does microglia-specific Ifnar1 deletion have on post-synaptic terminals?"
full_answer,"### Synthesized Answer:

Microglia-specific Ifnar1 deletion in 5XFAD mice attenuates the loss of post-synaptic terminals, suggesting a neuroprotective effect. This finding implies that microglial activation and inflammation, driven by Ifnar1, contribute to synaptic damage in this model."
