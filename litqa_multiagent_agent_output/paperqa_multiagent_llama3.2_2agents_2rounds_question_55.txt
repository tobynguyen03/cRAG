question,"Q: If implementing symmetric molecular dynamics as a holonomic constraint, how can Wyckoff sites be constrained?"
full_answer,"To constrain Wyckoff sites in symmetric molecular dynamics using holonomic constraints, Bravais Lattice projection tensors are utilized. This method effectively projects the system onto a specific crystal lattice orientation, allowing for precise control over Wyckoff site positions and velocities."
