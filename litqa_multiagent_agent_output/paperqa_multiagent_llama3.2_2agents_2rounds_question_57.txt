question,"Q: In 5XFAD mice, what effect does neural Ifnar1 deletion have on pre-synaptic terminals?"
full_answer,"**Neural Ifnar1 Deletion Effect on Pre-Synaptic Terminals**

Neural Ifnar1 deletion has been shown to attenuate (reduce) the loss of pre-synaptic terminals in 5XFAD mice. This suggests that removing or inhibiting Ifnar1 function may help preserve synaptic structure and function."
