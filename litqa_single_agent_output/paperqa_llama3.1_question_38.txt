full_answer,"Question: Q: How is Bempegaldesleukin supposed to overcome Treg affinity for IL-2?

Options:
A) Preferentially binding to b2b3 complex over b1b2b3 complex
B) Overcome the Treg affinity for IL-2 by selectively depleting intratumoral Tregs
C) Tumor microenvironment targeting and checkpoint immune inhibition
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) Improve PK via PEGylation

According to the text, Bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214) preferentially binds to the b1b2γ complex on cytotoxic T cells while reducing its affinity for the high-affinity heterotrimeric b1b2γ complex expressed by regulatory T cells (Tregs). This characteristic allows it to selectively stimulate cytotoxic T cell activity without promoting Treg expansion and activation.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Bempegaldesleukin reduces Treg affinity for IL-2 by preferentially binding to the b1b2γ complex on cytotoxic T cells rather than the high-affinity heterotrimeric b1b2γ complex on Tregs.
