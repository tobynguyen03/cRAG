full_answer,"Question: Q: What effect does infection of A. thaliana plants with avrE/hopM1 double knockout Pst DC3000 have on NCED3 expression?

Options:
A) no effect
B) reduced expression
C) Insufficient information to answer this question
D) Increased expression

According to Roussin2022 pages 11-12, infection of A. thaliana plants with avrE/hopM1 double knockout Pst DC3000 does not have a significant effect on NCED3 transcript levels at 24 h post-infection.

However, there is another relevant excerpt that states: ""Infection of A. thaliana plants with avrE/hopM1 double knockout Pst DC3000 results in intermediate NCED3 transcript levels at 7 h post-infection (Figures S6D and S6E)"" from Roussin2022 pages 12-13.

Considering these two excerpts, we can infer that infection of A. thaliana plants with avrE/hopM1 double knockout Pst DC3000 has a moderate effect on NCED3 expression at 7 h post-infection, but not a significant effect at 24 h post-infection.

Therefore, the answer is:

D) Increased expression (at 7 h post-infection), but not A) no effect (since there is some effect observed).

ANSWER SUMMARY: Infection of A. thaliana plants with avrE/hopM1 double knockout Pst DC3000 has a moderate increase in NCED3 transcript levels at 7 h post-infection, but not a significant effect at 24 h post-infection.
