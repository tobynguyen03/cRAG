full_answer,"Question: Q: Optogenetic inactivation of BNST AVP cells in mice leads to what kind of change in social communicative behaviors?

Options:
A) No difference in social communicative behaviors
B) Decreased level of ultrasonic sounds
C) Decrease in social communicative behaviors only in male mice
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) Increased level of urine marking

Based on the provided context, the correct answer is:

A) No difference in social communicative behaviors.

My reasoning process involves analyzing the results of optogenetic inactivation of BNST AVP cells in mice. According to Rigneya2024 pages 2-3, inhibiting BNST AVP cells did not alter time spent in the open arms of the elevated zero maze (an anxiety-like behavior) or affect urine marking and ultrasonic vocalizations, indicating no obvious change in anxiety-like states. This suggests that optogenetic inactivation of BNST AVP cells does not have a significant impact on social communicative behaviors.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Optogenetic inactivation of BNST AVP cells in mice results in no difference in social communicative behaviors.
