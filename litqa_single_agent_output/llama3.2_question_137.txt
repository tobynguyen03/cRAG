full_answer,"Question: Q: When a large excess of membrane protein substrate (Vamp2) is added to the wild-type Get3/4/5 chaperone complex, the complex dissociates into two components. Which component does the substrate bind to?

Options:
A) Get4/5 complex
B) Get4
C) Get5
D) Get3
E) Get3/4 complex
F) Insufficient information to answer this question

To determine which component of the Get3/4/5 chaperone complex Vamp2 binds to, we must analyze the given context.

The valid keys for this question are:

- Valid Keys: 

However, no information is provided about Vamp2 or its interaction with the Get3/4/5 complex. The context does not contain enough information to determine which component of the complex Vamp2 binds to.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Insufficient information is provided in the context to determine which component of the Get3/4/5 chaperone complex Vamp2 binds to, making option F the correct answer.
