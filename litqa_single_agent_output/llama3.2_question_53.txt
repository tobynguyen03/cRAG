full_answer,"Question: Q: I am designing peptide-guided LNPs for delivery to the retina, and am using PEG-maleimide to attach peptides to the the surface of the LNP. What fraction of the total PEG replaced with PEG-Maleimide would show no transfection?

Options:
A) Above 40%
B) Above 20%
C) Above 60%
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) Above 10%

Definition: 
PEG-maleimide refers to a type of PEG (Polyethylene Glycol) modification where maleimide groups are attached. PEG is used as a polymer component in drug delivery systems.

Answer:
A) Above 40%

Reasoning Process: The context states that formulations with over 40% substitution with PEG-maleimide showed no detectable levels of transfection, suggesting that the fraction of total PEG replaced with PEG-maleimide that would show no transfection is above 40%.

ANSWER SUMMARY: The study found that when more than 40% of total PEG was replaced with PEG-maleimide, there was no detectable level of transfection.
