full_answer,"Question: Q: Disruption of MTF1 expression in Chlamydomonas has what effect on the photosynthetic machinery?

Options:
A) Depletion of photosynthetic machinery
B) Upregulation of chloroplast-expressed proteins
C) No effect
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) Upregulation of photosynthetic machinery

According to Kafri et al. (2023) Cell 186(1), 5638–5655, disruption of MTF1 expression in Chlamydomonas has a severe photosynthetic phenotype, resulting in depletion of the entire photosynthetic apparatus and most chloroplast-expressed proteins (Kafri2023 pages 14-14). This was observed in proteomic experiments and validated by genetic rescue, which alleviated the growth defect and recovered expression of chloroplast-expressed proteins.

Furthermore, a comparison of chloroplast-expressed protein levels to nucleus-expressed protein levels for photosynthetic complexes in the mtf1 mutant suggests that MTF1 plays a role in regulating the translation of certain subsets of chloroplast-expressed proteins (Kafri2023 pages 14-15). The median of 6 independent experiments showed a decrease in protein levels of chloroplast-expressed genes in mtf1 mutants compared to wild-type, and a detailed comparison of specific chloroplast-expressed proteins also shows a decrease in these proteins in mtf1 mutants (Kafri2023 pages 44-44).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) Depletion of photosynthetic machinery

ANSWER SUMMARY: Disruption of MTF1 expression leads to depletion of the entire photosynthetic apparatus and most chloroplast-expressed proteins.
