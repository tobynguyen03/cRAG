full_answer,"Question: Q: What effect does infection of A. thaliana plants with avrE/hopM1 double knockout Pst DC3000 have on NCED3 expression?

Options:
A) no effect
B) reduced expression
C) Insufficient information to answer this question
D) Increased expression

Definition:
- NCED3 (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3) is a marker gene for abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis.

Answer:
Infection of A. thaliana plants with avrE/hopM1 double knockout Pst DC3000 leads to increased expression of the NCED3 gene, indicating an increase in ABA biosynthesis.

Reasoning process: The provided context from Roussin2022 pages 2-3 states that infection with avrE/hopM1 double knockout Pst DC3000 results in increased NCED3 expression compared to mock-infected plants. This suggests a positive correlation between the absence of HopM1 and AvrE1 and increased ABA biosynthesis.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Increased NCED3 expression following avrE/hopM1 double knockout Pst DC3000 infection indicates increased ABA biosynthesis in A. thaliana plants.
