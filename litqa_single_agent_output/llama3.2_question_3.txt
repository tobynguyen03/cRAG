Options:
A) 850
B) 400
C) 39
D) 12,300
E) 750
F) 2
G) Insufficient information to answer this question
H) 2
I) 4
J) 900

To determine the number of unique transposable element insertion loci in the mandarin (Citrus reticulata) genome, we need to look at relevant context.

In Wu1101 pages 8-11, it is mentioned that there are 12,309 Mandarin-specific ILs. However, this does not directly answer the question about the number of unique transposable element insertion loci in the mandarin genome.

Wu1101 pages 30-32 and 32-32 do not provide a specific count for mandarin. Instead, they mention the focus on citrus species, including sweet orange, but do not discuss the mandarin genome specifically.

Wu1101 pages 11-13 shows novel IL counts from 34 TE families in sweet orange, pummelo, and mandarin, but it does not provide a count for the mandarin genome.

On the other hand, Wu1101 pages 22-24 mention that transposon insertions are present as tag mutations for all sweet orange cultivar groups and can distinguish over 99% of SWO accessions. Although this does not directly address the question about mandarin, it highlights the presence of TE insertions in Citrus species.

Since the relevant context does not provide a direct count or sufficient information to answer the question accurately, we must choose option G) Insufficient information to answer this question from the available options.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Due to insufficient information, the exact number of unique transposable element insertion loci in the mandarin (Citrus reticulata) genome cannot be determined.
