full_answer,"Question: Q: What effect does infection of A. thaliana plants with hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000 have on NCED3 expression?

Options:
A) Increased expression
B) No effect
C) Insufficient information to answer this question
D) Reduced expression

The effect of infection of A. thaliana plants with hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000 on NCED3 expression is that it results in increased NCED3 expression.

My reasoning process was based on the provided context from Roussin2022 pages 9-11, which states: ""The study found that infection of A. thaliana plants with hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000 results in increased NCED3 expression."" Additionally, I considered the information from Roussin2022 pages 12-13 and Roussin2022 pages 11-12, where the same finding was mentioned for hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000 infection. These two studies support that hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000 results in increased NCED3 expression.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Infection of A. thaliana plants with hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000 leads to increased NCED3 expression.
