full_answer,"Question: Q: What effect does a F200Y mutation in fungal β-tubulin have on binding of the anti-fungal drug thiabendazole?

Options:
A) Disrupts binding
B) Enhances binding
C) Insufficient information to answer this question
D) No effect

To answer this question, we need to understand the effect of the F200Y mutation in fungal β-tubulin on the binding of thiabendazole.

The F200Y mutation refers to a specific genetic alteration in the fungal β-tubulin protein, where the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at position 200 is replaced with tyrosine (Y).

Thiabendazole is an anti-fungal drug that targets β-tubulin. The effect of the F200Y mutation on thiabendazole binding would depend on how the mutation alters the structure and function of β-tubulin.

However, without specific information on how the F200Y mutation affects the binding affinity or mode of action of thiabendazole to β-tubulin, we cannot provide a definitive answer. The context does not contain enough information to determine whether the mutation disrupts, enhances, or has no effect on thiabendazole binding.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Insufficient information to determine the effect of F200Y mutation on thiabendazole binding.
