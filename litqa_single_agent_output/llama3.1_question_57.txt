full_answer,"Question: Q: In 5XFAD mice, what effect does neural Ifnar1 deletion have on pre-synaptic terminals?

Options:
A) restoration
B) increased loss
C) no effect
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) attenuation of loss

Based on the provided context, specifically Ethan2022 pages 8-8 and 9-11, neural Ifnar1 deletion has a positive effect on pre-synaptic terminals in 5XFAD mice. It restores synaptophysin+ puncta density in 5XFAD;NKO mice, indicating a selective regulation of excitatory pre-synaptic bouton density during disease.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Neural Ifnar1 deletion restores pre-synaptic terminal function and density in 5XFAD mice by increasing the number of excitatory synaptic markers.
