full_answer,"Question: Q: How many differential H3K27Ac peaks are there between queen and worker honeybees?

Options:
A) 3601
B) 2165
C) 243
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) 1000

The researchers identified 3,601 differential peaks between queens and workers in terms of H3K27ac modifications.

My reasoning process involves carefully reading through the provided context and focusing on specific sections that mention H3K27ac modifications. On Jin2023 pages 4-5, it is stated that ""these peaks were enriched in pathways related to growth and development, ovarian development, and lifespan regulation."" Additionally, page 1 of Jin2023 mentions that queens have more chromosome interactions and unique H3K27ac modifications than workers.

ANSWER SUMMARY: 3601
