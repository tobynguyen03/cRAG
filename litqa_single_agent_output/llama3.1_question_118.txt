full_answer,"Question: Q: What is the mechanism for expression of the EPRS1(N1) form of EPRS1 in humans?

Options:
A) polyadenylation
B) post-transcriptional control
C) Insufficient information to answer this question
D) alternative splicing

Based on the provided context, specifically Eun2023 pages 4-5, the mechanism for expression of the EPRS1(N1) form of EPRS1 in humans is described as being generated by ""a novel polyadenylation event that introduces a new stop codon, resulting in a truncated C-terminus."" This indicates that option A) polyadenylation is the correct answer.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Polyadenylation is the mechanism for expression of the EPRS1(N1) form of EPRS1 in humans.
