full_answer,"Question: Q: Approximately how many unique transposable element insertion loci are there in the mandarin (Citrus reticulata) genome?

Options:
A) 850
B) 400
C) 39
D) 12,300
E) 750
F) 2
G) Insufficient information to answer this question
H) 2
I) 4
J) 900

Based on the provided context, specifically from Wu2022 pages 8-11, it is stated that ""our method detected 12,309 mandarin-specific ILs (transposable element insertion loci)."" This suggests that there are approximately 12,300 unique transposable element insertion loci in the mandarin genome.

The other options provided do not match this information. Option C mentions 39, which refers to the number of mandarin transcriptomes used for analysis, but it is not a direct count of unique ILs. The remaining options (A, B, E, F, G, H, I, and J) are not supported by the context.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Approximately 12,300 unique transposable element insertion loci in the mandarin genome based on Wu2022 pages 8-11.
