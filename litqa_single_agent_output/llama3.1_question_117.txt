full_answer,"Question: Q: What is the measured dissociation constant for the Wnt5b-Ror2 complex in cytonemes of zebrafish?

Options:
A) Between 113-276 nM
B) Between 476-511 nM
C) Between 301-475 nM
D) Between 311-476 nM
E) Between 311-476 uM
F) Insufficient information to answer this question

Based on the provided context, I will answer the question.

The dissociation constant (Kd) for the Wnt5b-Ror2 complex is mentioned in two different excerpts. In Chengting6631 pages 6-7, it is stated that the Kd for the Wnt5b-Ror2 complex using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) is ""440 ± 80 nM"". In Chengting6631 pages 2-2, a different measurement of dissociation constant is provided: ""229 nM"" with an additional information stating that this value was obtained in contrast to the negative control.

Since the question asks for the measured dissociation constant for the Wnt5b-Ror2 complex in cytonemes of zebrafish, I will focus on the two relevant excerpts. The first one provides a specific Kd value with an error margin: 440 ± 80 nM, which is within option B) Between 476-511 nM.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Based on the information from Chengting6631 pages 6-7, the correct answer is that the measured dissociation constant for the Wnt5b-Ror2 complex in cytonemes of zebrafish is between 360-520 nM.
