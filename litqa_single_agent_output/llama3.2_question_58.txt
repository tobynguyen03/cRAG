full_answer,"Question: Q: In Arabidopsis, which of the following 20 S proteasome subunits has CWC15 not been shown to interact with in its role promoting degradation of the protein Serrate?

Options:
A) PBE1
B) PAG1
C) PBA1
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) PAB1

Definition: 
- 20S proteasome: a large protein complex that breaks down damaged or unneeded proteins in cells.
- PAB1, PAG1, PBA1, and PBE1 are subunits of the 20S proteasome in Arabidopsis.

Answer:
Based on the provided context, CWC15 has been shown to interact with certain 20 S proteasome subunits, including PAB1, PAG1, and PBA1, but not PBE1. Therefore, the correct answer is A) PBE1.

ANSWER SUMMARY: CWC15 does not interact with PBE1 in promoting degradation of protein Serrate.
