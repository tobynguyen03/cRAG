According to Roussin2022 pages 3-3, infection of A. thaliana plants with avrE single knockout Pst DC3000 resulted in an increase in NCED3 expression, but only half the level of induction induced by wild-type Pst DC3000.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Increased expression, but reduced to half the level compared to wild-type Pseudomonas syringae.
