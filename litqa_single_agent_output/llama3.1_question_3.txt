full_answer,"Question: Q: Approximately how many unique transposable element insertion loci are there in the mandarin (Citrus reticulata) genome?

Options:
A) 850
B) 400
C) 39
D) 12,300
E) 750
F) 2
G) Insufficient information to answer this question
H) 2
I) 4
J) 900

The correct answer is D) 12,300.

My reasoning process is as follows:

* In Wu1101 pages 8-11, it is stated that the authors surveyed 12,309 mandarin-specific ILs (transposable element insertion loci). This indicates that there are approximately 12,300 unique transposable element insertion loci in the mandarin genome.
* The other options do not match this number. Option C) 39 refers to the transcriptomes analyzed for the mandarin genome, but it does not provide information about the total number of ILs. Options A, E, F, G, H, and I are incorrect because they do not match the number mentioned in Wu1101 pages 8-11.
* Option B) 400 is close to the correct answer but still lower than the actual number.

ANSWER SUMMARY: The correct answer is D) 12,300, as it is supported by information from Wu1101 pages 8-11 that states there are approximately 12,309 mandarin-specific ILs.
