Definition: NCAN-ELS domain refers to a specific protein-protein interaction complex between Neurocan (NCAN) and Exon-Like Small (ELS).

Reasoning process: The context does not provide any explicit information about the percentage of inhibitory synapses that interact with the NCAN-ELS domain.

Given that there is no relevant data or studies mentioned in the provided context, I must conclude that the question cannot be answered accurately.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Insufficient information available to determine the interaction percentage.
