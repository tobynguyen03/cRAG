full_answer,"Question: Q: What effect does a F200Y mutation in fungal β-tubulin have on binding of the anti-fungal drug thiabendazole?

Options:
A) Disrupts binding
B) Enhances binding
C) Insufficient information to answer this question
D) No effect

The F200Y mutation in fungal β-tubulin disrupts the binding of thiabendazole.

The context provides multiple references to the effect of the F200Y mutation on thiabendazole binding. Garge2011 pages 6-7 state that the mutation affects the interaction with thiabendazole, while pages 5-6 mention in silico docking studies predicting unfavorable repulsions between the mutated β-tubulin and thiabendazole due to the loss of F200. Pages 12-13 further support this by stating that the mutation can affect the binding of anti-fungal drugs, including thiabendazole.

ANSWER SUMMARY: The F200Y mutation in fungal β-tubulin disrupts the binding of thiabendazole due to unfavorable repulsions and loss of key binding site residue F200.
