full_answer,"Question: Q: What is the measured dissociation constant for the Wnt5b-Ror2 complex in cytonemes of zebrafish?

Options:
A) Between 113-276 nM
B) Between 476-511 nM
C) Between 301-475 nM
D) Between 311-476 nM
E) Between 311-476 uM
F) Insufficient information to answer this question

The measured dissociation constant for the Wnt5b-Ror2 complex in cytonemes of zebrafish varies across different studies. However, based on the provided context, we can identify the most relevant information.

Chengting6631 pages 10-11 reports that the Kd values were > 2000 nM for each channel, indicating a strong interaction between the complex. 

Chengting Zhang et al. (2023) also reported a Kd value of 229 nM and another study found a mean Kd of 720±160 nM.

However, there is no clear indication that these values represent the dissociation constant for the Wnt5b-Ror2 complex in cytonemes specifically. 

Moreover, from Chengting Zhang et al. (2023) ""Cytoneme-mediated transport of active Wnt5b–Ror2 complexes in zebrafish,"" there are references to the measured values at 229 nM and 440±80 nM.

Since these studies have provided different information about the dissociation constant, we can infer that the answer would require further analysis or comparison between multiple studies.


ANSWER SUMMARY: The dissociation constant for the Wnt5b-Ror2 complex in cytonemes of zebrafish is not consistently reported across all references.
