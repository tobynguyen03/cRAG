full_answer,"Question: Q: Active olfactory receptor genes increase their contacts with greek island regions by what factor in mouse olfactory neurons?

Options:
A) 2.0 fold
B) 27 fold
C) 3.0 fold
D) 2.7 fold
E) 1.7 fold
F) Insufficient information to answer this question

The correct factor is 27-fold.

This can be deduced from Ariel7928 pages 3-4, which states that ""Active olfactory receptor genes increase their contacts with Greek island regions by a factor of 27-fold in mouse olfactory neurons."" The context provided does not mention any other possible factors (e.g., 2.7-fold or 2.0-fold), making option B) the only correct answer.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Active olfactory receptor genes increase their contacts with Greek island regions by a factor of 27-fold in mouse olfactory neurons, based on Ariel7928 pages 3-4.
