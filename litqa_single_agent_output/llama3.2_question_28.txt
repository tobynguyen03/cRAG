full_answer,"Question: Q: Grafting ECL3 region from adenosine A3 receptor A3AR onto A2AAR does what to the efficacy of binding to the A3AR antagonist CF101 ?

Options:
A) increases
B) decreases
C) greatly decreases
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) no change

To answer this question, we need to analyze the provided context.

The context states that grafting the ECL3 region from A3AR onto A2AAR reduces its efficacy in binding to CF101, an antagonist for A3AR. This is mentioned in two different sections of the text: Hongmin2024 pages 3-4 and 5-6.

The section on pages 3-4 states that grafting the ECL3 region affects the receptor's ability to bind CF101, suggesting that the ECL3 region plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and structural integrity of A3AR. 

On pages 5-6, it mentions that swapping the ECL3 residues results in a significant loss of binding ability.

Therefore, based on this information, grafting the ECL3 region from adenosine receptor A3AR (A3AR) onto A2AAR decreases its efficacy in binding to CF101.


ANSWER SUMMARY: Grafting ECL3 region from A3AR onto A2AAR decreases its efficacy in binding to CF101.
