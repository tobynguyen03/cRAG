full_answer,"Question: Q: At which amino acid position is a large oligosaccharide density observed in the cryo-EM map of Nav1.6?

Options:
A) Asn326
B) Phe302
C) Trp324
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) Leu288

The large oligosaccharide density is observed at the position corresponding to Asn326.

ANSWER SUMMARY: A) Asn326 is correct based on page 2-3 of Xiao2024, where it states that ""the glycan density is well-resolved, allowing for tracing nine monosaccharides unambiguously"" and Figure 2C shows the large oligosaccharide density attaching to Asn326.
