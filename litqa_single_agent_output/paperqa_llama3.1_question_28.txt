Options:
A) increases
B) decreases
C) greatly decreases
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) no change

The grafting of ECL3 region from adenosine A3 receptor A3AR onto A2AAR resulted in a significant increase in the efficacy of binding to the A3AR antagonist CF101 (Hongmin2024 pages 9-10).

ANSWER SUMMARY: Grafting ECL3 from A3AR onto A2AAR increases efficacy of binding to CF101.
