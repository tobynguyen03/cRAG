full_answer,"Question: Q: How does P. falciparum gene expression change with aging for male and female organisms?

Options:
A) Gene expression decreases as P. falciparum ages for both males and females with aging.
B) Gene expression increases for P. falciparum males and decreases for females with aging.
C) Gene expression decreases for P. falciparum males and increases for females with aging.
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) Gene expression increases as P. falciparum ages for both males and females with aging.

Based on the provided context, particularly from Sunil2024 pages 10-10, it is evident that:

Gene expression changes with aging in P. falciparum parasites. Specifically, for male parasites (LE gametocytes), gene expression remains high throughout their lifespan. In contrast, female parasites show a decrease in gene expression as they age.

This information directly supports option B: Gene expression increases for P. falciparum males and decreases for females with aging.

ANSWER SUMMARY: The correct answer is B) Gene expression increases for P. falciparum males and decreases for females with aging, based on the observation that male gametocytes show active transcription throughout their lifespan, while female gametocytes' gene expression decreases as they age.
