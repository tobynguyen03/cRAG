full_answer,"Question: Q: I am designing peptide-guided LNPs for delivery to the retina, and am using PEG-maleimide to attach peptides to the the surface of the LNP. What fraction of the total PEG replaced with PEG-Maleimide would show no transfection?

Options:
A) Above 40%
B) Above 20%
C) Above 60%
D) Insufficient information to answer this question
E) Above 10%

The fraction of total PEG replaced with PEG-Maleimide that would show no transfection is above 40%. 

This conclusion can be derived from Herrera2023 pages 5-6, which states ""formulations with over 40% substitution with PEG-maleimide showed no detectable levels of transfection.""

ANSWER SUMMARY: Above 40%, according to the text, formulations with more than 40% PEG-Maleimide substitution show no detectable transfection.
