full_answer,"Question: Q: When a large excess of membrane protein substrate (Vamp2) is added to the wild-type Get3/4/5 chaperone complex, the complex dissociates. Which component does the substrate not bind to?

Options:
A) Get5
B) Get3/4 complex
C) Get4
D) Get4/5 complex
E) Get3
F) Insufficient information to answer this question

Definition:

* Vamp2: A membrane protein substrate (likely referring to Vamp2, a v-SNARE involved in exocytosis)
* Get3/4/5 chaperone complex: A molecular chaperone complex consisting of three subunits (Get3, Get4, and Get5)

Answer:

When a large excess of Vamp2 is added to the wild-type Get3/4/5 chaperone complex, it dissociates. This suggests that Vamp2 binding causes a conformational change or destabilization of the complex. The most likely explanation is that Vamp2 binds to Get4, as it is one of the three subunits of the complex.

The Get3 and Get5 subunits are less likely to be bound by Vamp2, as they form a dimeric structure with Get4 (Get3/4 and Get4/5 complexes). The dissociation of the complex suggests that Vamp2 binding preferentially occurs at the Get4 subunit.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Vamp2 binds to the Get4 subunit, causing the dissociation of the Get3/4/5 chaperone complex.
