full_answer,"Question: Q: What effect does infection of A. thaliana plants with hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000 have on NCED3 expression?

Options:
A) Increased expression
B) No effect
C) Insufficient information to answer this question
D) Reduced expression

Based on the provided context, specifically Roussin2022 pages 12-13, it is stated that infection of min7 A. thaliana plants with hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000 at 24 hours post-infection results in intermediate NCED3 transcript levels.

However, this specific information only pertains to the interaction between min7 mutants and a pathogen with a hopM1 knockout. For the general effect of infection of A. thaliana plants with hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000 on NCED3 expression, we need to look at Roussin2022 pages 11-11 which states that in infected Arabidopsis plants, the expression levels of the ABA biosynthesis marker gene NCED3 were unaltered when compared to control strains or effector-less strains.

Therefore, since the information regarding hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000's effect on NCED3 expression is directly mentioned and stated as having ""no significant differences"" or being ""unaltered,"" we can conclude that the general effect of infection of A. thaliana plants with hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000 on NCED3 expression is to have no effect.

ANSWER SUMMARY: Infection of A. thaliana plants with hopM1 knockout Pst DC3000 has no significant effect on NCED3 expression, based on the text stating ""unaltered"" expression levels in infected Arabidopsis compared to control strains or effector-less strains.
