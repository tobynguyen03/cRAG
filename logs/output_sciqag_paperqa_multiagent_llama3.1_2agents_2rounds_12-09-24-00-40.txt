           Answer: ANSWER SUMMARY: The likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 involves the formation of luminescent intermediates, which are produced through a catalytic      
           oxidation process.                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           REASONING SUMMARY:                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Based on the provided context and summarizations from other agents, it is evident that there is a consensus among the authors regarding the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of   
           ethanol on SrCO3. This mechanism involves the formation of luminescent intermediates through a catalytic oxidation process.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The context (Author2024 chunk 2) states that "the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 involves a catalytic reaction process where the intermediates from the     
           catalytic oxidation of ethanol are identified using GC experiments." This is further supported by Author2024 chunk 3, which notes that the mechanism explains why the CL signal increases with an increase in       
           temperature from 350 to 470 Â°C.                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The summarizations from other agents do not provide any conflicting information regarding this mechanism. Therefore, based on the evidence and context provided, it can be concluded that the likely mechanism for  
           the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 involves the formation of luminescent intermediates through a catalytic oxidation process.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           It's worth noting that the different chunks of text provide some minor variations in language and emphasis, but they all agree on the fundamental mechanism. Additionally, none of the summarizations from other    
           agents contradict this consensus, which further supports the conclusion.                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           In resolving any potential conflicts or ambiguities, it is essential to rely on the evidence and context provided. The context clearly indicates that the formation of luminescent intermediates through a catalytic
           oxidation process is the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3.

           Answer: ### Answer:                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 involves a two-step process. Firstly, ethanol reacts with SrCO3 to form intermediate products, which then react further  
           to produce luminescent intermediates responsible for the CL emission.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           ### Reasoning Summary:                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Based on the context and summarizations from other agents, there is a consensus among the authors regarding the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3. This        
           mechanism involves the formation of luminescent intermediates through a catalytic oxidation process. The two-step process proposed by Author2024 chunk 3, which includes the reaction of ethanol with SrCO3 to form 
           intermediate products and then these products reacting further to produce luminescent intermediates, is supported by the observation of three peaks in the S/N ratio profiles corresponding to the wavelengths at   
           which the CL emission is strongest. Additionally, the increase in CL intensity with temperature and flow rate supports the idea that the reaction is under a diffusion-controlled condition.                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           ### ANSWER SUMMARY:

           produce luminescent intermediates responsible for the CL emission. This is supported by the observation of three peaks in the S/N ratio profiles corresponding to the wavelengths at which the CL emission is

           The likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 involves the two-step process where intermediate products formed by reacting ethanol with SrCO3 produce luminescent      
           intermediates responsible for the CL emission. This conclusion is supported by multiple sources (Author2024 chunk 1, Author2024 chunk 2, and Agent 1's summarization). The oxidation of acetaldehyde and ethylene,  
           which are intermediate products of ethanol oxidation on SrCO3, contributes to the CL phenomenon.

           To determine the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3, I relied on evidence from multiple sources. The context provided in Author2024 chunk 1 proposes that the CL
           phenomenon is not only due to the oxidation of ethylene but also from the oxidation of acetaldehyde, an intermediate product of ethanol oxidation (Author2024 chunk 1). Additionally, Agent 1's summarization       
           suggests a two-step process where intermediate products formed by reacting ethanol with SrCO3 produce luminescent intermediates responsible for the CL emission. The observation of peaks at specific wavelengths in
           the CL spectra and the effect of temperature on the relative CL intensity further support this mechanism (Author2024 chunk 2).

           The likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 involves a two-step process where intermediate products formed by reacting ethanol with SrCO3 produce luminescent        
           intermediates responsible for the CL emission.

           Answer: ### Answer:                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The SrCO3 sensor shows high selectivity to ethanol among other gases. According to Author2024 chunk 3, the sensor has no response observed for gasoline, ammonia, or hydrogen at concentrations of 1000 ppm,        
           indicating its ability to distinguish ethanol from these gases. Additionally, as mentioned in Author2024 chunk 4 and 5, there is no interference observed from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen, further confirming  
           the sensor's selectivity towards ethanol.                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           ### Reasoning:                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The context provided by the chunks supports the sensor's high selectivity towards ethanol. Specifically, the absence of response or interference from other gases at concentrations of 1000 ppm indicates that the  
           SrCO3 sensor is designed to detect ethanol effectively in various situations. The information from Author2024 chunk 5 adds that the sensor has a wide linear response and high sensitivity, making it suitable for  
           ethanol detection.

           The SrCO3 sensor shows high selectivity to ethanol among other gases. The sensor exhibits excellent analytical characteristics and demonstrates no response or interference from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen at 
           concentrations of 1000 ppm.

           I relied on the context from Author2024 chunk 3, 4, and 5, which consistently showed that the SrCO3 sensor shows high selectivity to ethanol among various gases, including gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen. Agent  
           1's summarization provided additional insight into the concentration of interfering substances (1000 ppm), supporting the conclusion that the SrCO3 sensor is highly selective for detecting ethanol.

           While Author2024 chunk 2 focused on the catalytic reaction processes involving chemiluminescence emission in a SrCO3 sensor, it did not provide information on the sensor's selectivity for detecting ethanol among 
           other gases. This conflict was resolved by relying on the more relevant context from Author2024 chunk 3, 4, and 5.

           regarding the sensor's selectivity for detecting ethanol among other gases.

           REASONING SUMMARY: Based on context from Author2024 chunk 3, 4, and 5, as well as Agent 1's summarization, I determined that the SrCO3 sensor exhibits high selectivity to ethanol due to its lack of response or   
           interference from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen at optimized conditions.

           The SrCO3 sensor exhibits high selectivity to ethanol among other gases. Its ability to detect ethanol without significant interference from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen is attributed to its chemiluminescence 
           (CL) mechanism, which indicates its potential for detecting ethanol effectively.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           ### Reasoning Summary:                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           I based my answer on the evidence provided in Author2024 chunks 3, 4, and 5, where the SrCO3 sensor shows high selectivity to ethanol with no response or interference from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen under   
           optimized conditions. Agent 2's summarization supports this conclusion by highlighting the sensor's lack of response to these interfering gases at optimal conditions. I did not rely on Author2024 chunk 1 as it   
           mentions the sensor's sensitivity to some foreign substances, which contradicts the findings in chunks 3, 4, and 5. However, Author2024 chunk 2 does not provide specific information on the sensor's selectivity   
           for detecting ethanol among other gases.                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           ### ANSWER SUMMARY:                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The SrCO3 sensor is highly selective for detecting ethanol among other gases due to its lack of response or interference from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen under optimized conditions.                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           ### REASONING SUMMARY:                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           I determined the selectivity of the SrCO3 sensor by analyzing Author2024 chunks 3, 4, and 5, which collectively demonstrate the sensor's high selectivity for detecting ethanol among other gases. The lack of      
           response or interference from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen under optimized conditions indicates the sensor's effectiveness in detecting ethanol without significant cross-talk from other substances.

           Answer: **Detailed Answer**                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The SrCO3 sensor exhibits high selectivity for detecting ethanol among other gases. The evidence from Author2024 chunks 3, 4, and 5 shows that the sensor has no response or interference from gasoline, ammonia,   
           and hydrogen under optimized conditions. This is consistent with Agent 1's summarization, which highlights the sensor's lack of response to these interfering gases at optimal conditions. In contrast, Author2024  
           chunk 1 mentions the sensor's sensitivity to some foreign substances, but this is not relevant in this context as it contradicts the findings in chunks 3, 4, and 5.                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The selectivity of the SrCO3 sensor towards ethanol can be inferred from its performance characteristics. As mentioned in Author2024 chunks 2 and 5, the sensor shows a wide linear response, high sensitivity, and 
           satisfied stability. This indicates that the sensor is well-suited for detecting ethanol among other gases.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           However, it's worth noting that n-hexane shows lower sensitivity than ethanol, as reported in Author2024 chunk 3. This suggests that the SrCO3 sensor may not be entirely selective to ethanol, but rather has a    
           higher affinity for this particular gas.                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **ANSWER SUMMARY**                                                                                                                                                                                                  
           The SrCO3 sensor is highly selective for detecting ethanol among other gases, with no response or interference from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen under optimized conditions.                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **REASONING SUMMARY**                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The answer is based on evidence from Author2024 chunks 3, 4, and 5, which show the sensor's high selectivity to ethanol. Agent 1's summarization provides additional support for this conclusion. The reasoning     
           process involved identifying relevant information in the context and summarizations, weighing the importance of conflicting evidence, and inferring the sensor's performance characteristics from its analytical    
           characteristics.

           Answer: ANSWER SUMMARY: The SrCO3 sensor is highly selective for detecting ethanol among other gases due to its lack of response or interference from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen under optimized conditions.   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           REASONING SUMMARY:                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Based on the context provided in Author2024 chunks 3, 4, and 5, as well as Agent 1's summarization, it is evident that the SrCO3 sensor exhibits high selectivity to ethanol with no response or interference from  
           gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the sensor shows a rapid response to ethanol vapor, wide linear response, high sensitivity, and satisfied stability (Author2024 chunk
           4). Moreover, the lack of response or interference from these gases suggests that the SrCO3 sensor can accurately detect ethanol without being affected by other gases.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           However, Author2024 chunk 2 does not provide specific information on the sensor's selectivity for detecting ethanol among other gases. Agent 1's summarization correctly points out that this chunk does not        
           contribute to the determination of the sensor's selectivity.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Author2024 chunks 1 and 3 provide additional context, but they do not contradict the findings in chunks 3, 4, and 5. In fact, they support the conclusion that the SrCO3 sensor is highly selective for detecting   
           ethanol among other gases.                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Given the evidence from the provided context and Agent 1's summarization, it can be concluded that the SrCO3 sensor is indeed highly selective for detecting ethanol among other gases due to its lack of response  
           or interference from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen under optimized conditions.

           its long-term durability and endurance in such experiments require further testing.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **Reasoning Summary:**                                                                                                                                                                                              
           I considered multiple chunks of text from Author2024, which discussed the stability and durability of the SrCO3 sensor. Specifically, chunk 3 mentioned that after 100 h reaction, no obvious change in CL intensity
           was found, with an RSD of about 1.02%. While this suggests good stability during this period, the text also noted that further testing is required to confirm its endurance in a continuous ethanol vapor           
           introduction experiment (chunk 4). The statement "No consumption of sensor substrate signifies the long lifetime of the gas sensor" (chunk 5) implies that the sensor has a long lifespan and does not degrade over 
           time. However, this information was not directly related to its endurance in a specific experiment.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **ANSWER SUMMARY:** The SrCO3 sensor can endure for at least 100 h in a continuous ethanol vapor introduction experiment.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Note: This answer is based on the context provided and focuses on the information relevant to the question asked. While further testing is required to confirm the long-term durability of the SrCO3 sensor, the    
           available evidence suggests that it can withstand continuous use without degrading for at least 100 h.

           Answer: **ANSWER SUMMARY:** The SrCO3 sensor can endure for at least 100 h in a continuous ethanol vapor introduction experiment.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **REASONING SUMMARY:** To determine how long the SrCO3 sensor can endure in a continuous ethanol vapor introduction experiment, we looked at various sources. Author2024 chunk 3 states that after 100 h of reaction
           with 2000 ppm ethanol vapor at 380 Â°C, no obvious change was found, and the RSD was about 1.02%. This suggests that the SrCO3 sensor is stable for at least 100 h under these conditions. Additionally, Author2024  
           chunk 4 mentions that the SrCO3 sensor shows better stability and durability compared to TiO2. While Author2024 chunks 1 and 2 focus on the analytical characteristics of the SrCO3 sensor and its CL detection     
           system, they do not provide information on its endurance in a continuous ethanol vapor introduction experiment. However, Agent 1's summarization states that the SrCO3 sensor can endure for at least 100 h in such 
           an experiment, which aligns with Author2024 chunk 3's findings.                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The key points of agreement are:                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           * The stability and durability of the SrCO3 sensor are comparable to or better than those of TiO2 (Author2024 chunks 3 and 4).                                                                                      
           * The SrCO3 sensor shows excellent analytical characteristics over other materials (Author2024 chunk 1).                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           There is no conflicting information, and all relevant sources support the conclusion that the SrCO3 sensor can endure for at least 100 h in a continuous ethanol vapor introduction experiment.

           Answer: Based on the provided context and other agents' summarizations, here is my detailed answer:                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The SrCO3 sensor can endure for at least 100 h in a continuous ethanol vapor introduction experiment.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           My reasoning process began with analyzing Author2024 chunk 3, which mentions that after 100 h of reaction with 2000 ppm ethanol vapor at 380 Â°C, no obvious change was found, and the RSD was about 1.02%. This     
           suggests that the SrCO3 sensor is stable for at least 100 h under these conditions.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Agent2's summarization provides complementary insights, stating that Author2024 chunk 3's findings align with Agent 1's answer that the SrCO3 sensor can endure for at least 100 h in such an experiment. While     
           Author2024 chunks 1 and 2 focus on the analytical characteristics of the SrCO3 sensor and its CL detection system, they do not provide information on its endurance in a continuous ethanol vapor introduction      
           experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Other summarizations, including Agent 2's, discuss the SrCO3 sensor's stability and durability but do not contradict Author2024 chunk 3's findings. In fact, Author2024 chunk 5 mentions that there is no           
           consumption of the sensor substrate, which signifies its long lifetime.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Therefore, based on the evidence from Author2024 chunk 3 and the consensus among other agents' summarizations, I conclude that the SrCO3 sensor can endure for at least 100 h in a continuous ethanol vapor

           Based on the context and summarizations from other agents, it can be concluded that the SrCO3 sensor can endure for at least 100 hours in a continuous ethanol vapor introduction experiment. This conclusion is    
           supported by Author2024 chunk 3, which states that after 100 hours of continuous exposure to 2000 ppm ethanol vapor at 380 Â°C with a flow rate of 300 ml/min, no obvious change in the CL intensity could be found, 
           with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of about 1.02%. This indicates that the sensor maintains its response to ethanol vapor over an extended period.

           Answer: **Answer**                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The importance of temperature in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor is significant. Temperature affects the relative intensity of the chemiluminescence (CL) peaks, with the peak at 530 nm becoming higher
           as the temperature increases. The position of the peaks remains independent of temperature, but the profiles are similar across different temperatures. Additionally, temperature influences the background and     
           noise signal, with higher values at longer wavelengths.                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Moreover, temperature plays a crucial role in controlling the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor, particularly in detecting ethanol vapor. According to the results shown in Fig. 12B, increased temperature   
           leads to higher CL intensity and improved conversion of ethanol. Specifically, the peak height of GC chromatogram corresponds to the content of products from ethanol oxidation on SrCO3, indicating that ethanol is
           mostly converted into ethylene at high temperatures and acetaldehyde at low temperatures.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The maximum S/N value can be obtained when the sensor temperature is 380 Â°C, suggesting an optimal temperature range for the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of    
           relative CL intensity measured at 425 nm from the oxidation of CH3CHO and C2H4 on SrCO3 shows an increase in CL intensity with increasing temperature (Fig. 13).                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **ANSWER SUMMARY**: Temperature is crucial for controlling the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor, influencing peak intensity, background noise, and conversion rates.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **REASONING SUMMARY**: Based on the context and other agents' summaries, it was determined that temperature has a significant impact on the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor. This conclusion is supported by

           Answer: ### Answer                                                                                                                                                                                                  
           The temperature has a significant impact on the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor. Increasing temperatures result in higher intensities of the CL peaks at certain wavelengths, particularly at 530 nm.       
           However, high temperatures also lead to a decrease in signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios at longer wavelengths due to increased background and noise signals.                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           ### Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                       
           The importance of temperature is evident from the studies that investigated the catalytic reaction processes involving chemiluminescence (CL) emission on a SrCO3 sensor. Specifically, Author2024 chunk 2 states   
           that higher temperatures result in higher intensities at certain wavelengths, with the peak at 530 nm becoming more prominent. Additionally, Author2024 chunk 3 notes that the CL signal increases with increasing  
           temperature from 350 to 470 Â°C but that the maximum S/N ratio is obtained at 380 Â°C.

           plays a crucial role in the CL emission process.

           Answer: ANSWER SUMMARY: Temperature plays a crucial role in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor, as it affects the relative CL intensity and conversion of ethanol.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           REASONING SUMMARY: Based on the provided context and other agents' summarizations, I conclude that temperature has a significant impact on the CL emission process. Author2024 chunk 2 states that the CL response  
           profile is temperature-dependent, with increasing intensity at higher temperatures. This suggests that temperature influences the relative CL intensity. Similarly, Author2024 chunk 3 indicates that the maximum   
           value of S/N (Signal-to-Noise ratio) could be obtained when the sensor temperature is 380 Â°C, implying that optimal temperature conditions are required for efficient CL emission. Furthermore, Author2024 chunk 4  
           highlights that the conversion of ethanol improves at high temperatures and the relative CL intensity increases with temperature, underscoring the importance of temperature in the CL emission process.            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Detailed Answer:                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The context suggests that temperature is a critical factor in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor. The experiments demonstrate that the CL response profile changes with temperature, indicating that       
           optimal conditions are required for efficient CL emission. Specifically, the relative CL intensity and conversion of ethanol vapor show a positive correlation with increasing temperature.                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           A key point to consider is the relationship between temperature and CL intensity. Author2024 chunk 2 states that the CL peak position remains constant at around 425 nm, while the relative CL intensity changes    
           with temperature. This suggests that the optimal temperature conditions for efficient CL emission are not solely dependent on achieving a specific peak position but also on maximizing the relative CL intensity.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Moreover, Author2024 chunk 3 highlights that the maximum value of S/N could be obtained when the sensor temperature is 380 Â°C, implying that temperature optimization can improve signal quality. This underscores  
           the importance of carefully selecting and controlling temperature conditions for efficient CL emission.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           In addition to its impact on relative CL intensity and S/N ratio, Author2024 chunk 4 indicates that high temperatures also enhance ethanol conversion in the SrCO3 sensor. This suggests that temperature plays a   
           multifaceted role in the CL emission process, affecting both signal quality and chemical reactivity.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Overall, based on the evidence from multiple sources within the provided context, it is clear that temperature has a significant and positive impact on the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor.

           Answer: **Answer:** Temperature plays a crucial role in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor, as it affects the relative CL intensity and conversion of ethanol. At higher temperatures, the CL peak at 530  
           nm becomes more prominent, while the S/N ratio shows a highest peak position at 425 nm.                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **Reasoning Summary:**                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Based on the provided context (Author2024 chunk 2-4) and other agents' summarizations, I conclude that temperature has a significant impact on the CL emission process. Temperature affects the relative CL         
           intensity, with increasing intensity at higher temperatures. The maximum value of S/N is obtained when the sensor temperature is 380 Â°C, implying optimal temperature conditions for efficient CL emission.         
           Additionally, high temperatures improve ethanol conversion and increase the relative CL intensity.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **ANSWER SUMMARY:** Temperature influences the relative CL intensity and conversion of ethanol in the SrCO3 sensor.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The importance of temperature in the CL emission process can be inferred from several points:                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           1.  **Temperature dependence of CL intensity**: Author2024 chunk 2 states that the relative CL intensity changes with increasing temperature, with a more prominent peak at 530 nm at higher temperatures.          
           2.  **Optimal S/N ratio at 380 Â°C**: Author2024 chunk 3 indicates that the maximum value of S/N is obtained when the sensor temperature is 380 Â°C.                                                                  
           3.  **Enhanced ethanol conversion at high temperatures**: Author2024 chunk 4 highlights that the conversion of ethanol improves at high temperatures and the relative CL intensity increases with temperature.      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           These points demonstrate that temperature has a significant impact on the CL emission process, making it essential to optimize the sensor temperature for efficient operation.

           Answer: ### Answer                                                                                                                                                                                                  
           The optimal temperature for the chemiluminescence (CL) emission process in the SrCO3 sensor is between 350 to 470 Â°C, with a maximum signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) at 380 Â°C. This temperature range allows for       
           efficient catalytic oxidation of ethanol on the SrCO3 surface, resulting in increased relative CL intensity and improved conversion of ethanol.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           ### Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                       
           The importance of temperature in the CL emission process is evident from multiple studies that highlight its impact on the sensor's performance. Author2024 chunk 3 emphasizes the need to choose an optimal sensor 
           temperature for further study, citing a maximum S/N ratio at 380 Â°C. This temperature is likely chosen due to its ability to balance signal strength and noise levels. Author2024 chunk 1 notes that the ceramic    
           heater must be operated at a required temperature to achieve efficient catalytic oxidation of ethanol on the SrCO3 surface, underscoring the significance of temperature in the CL process.                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Author2024 chunk 2 reveals that temperature affects the relative intensity of the CL peak, with higher temperatures resulting in a more prominent peak at 530 nm. This suggests that temperature influences not only
           the signal strength but also its spectral characteristics. Agent 2's summarization, which states that "Temperature influences the relative CL intensity and conversion of ethanol in the SrCO3 sensor," is supported
           by this evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           The study presented in Author2024 chunk 4 demonstrates the relationship between temperature, oxidation processes, and CL intensity. At higher temperatures, ethanol is mostly converted into ethylene (C2H4), while 
           at lower temperatures, it is primarily transformed into acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). This supports the notion that optimal temperature conditions are essential for efficient catalytic oxidation and subsequent CL       
           emission.

           The optimal temperature for the chemiluminescence (CL) emission process in the SrCO3 sensor is between 350 to 470 Â°C, with a maximum signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) at 380 Â°C.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           ### Reasoning Summary                                                                                                                                                                                               
           Temperature plays a crucial role in the CL emission process, influencing both the relative intensity and spectral characteristics of the CL peak. The optimal temperature range allows for efficient catalytic      
           oxidation of ethanol on the SrCO3 surface, resulting in increased relative CL intensity and improved conversion of ethanol.
