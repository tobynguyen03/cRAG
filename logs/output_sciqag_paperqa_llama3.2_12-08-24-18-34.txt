[18:34:28] Generating answer for 'What is the most commonly used plasticizer in the world?'.                                              
[18:34:31] Status: Paper Count=0 | Relevant Papers=0 | Current Evidence=0 | Current Cost=$0.0000                                          
           Answer: To answer this question, I'll need to make an assumption about what "Valid Keys" refers to. Assuming it's related to   
           the context of plasticizers, I'll consider it as a list of valid or commonly used plasticizers.                                
                                                                                                                                          
           Given the lack of specific information in the provided context, I'll rely on general knowledge about common plasticizers. A    
           widely used and well-known plasticizer is Phthalates. Specifically, DEP (Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) was one of the most       
           commonly used plasticizers in the past.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                          
           However, due to health concerns and regulatory actions, many countries have restricted or banned the use of certain Phthalates.
           A more commonly used alternative today is DEHP's (Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) counterpart, DIPHP (Dioctyl Phthalate).          
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: The most commonly used plasticizer in the world is likely a Phthalate derivative, with DEP and its alternatives
           being widely used but subject to restrictions.

[18:34:33] Starting paper search for 'extraction temperature effect on SPME fibre efficiency'.

           Status: Paper Count=8 | Relevant Papers=0 | Current Evidence=0 | Current Cost=$0.0000                                          
           Generating answer for 'How does the extraction temperature affect the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre?'.               
[18:35:04] Status: Paper Count=8 | Relevant Papers=2 | Current Evidence=3 | Current Cost=$0.0000                                          
           Answer: The extraction temperature affects the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre in the following way:                   
                                                                                                                                          
           A higher temperature accelerates the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increases their concentration in the 
           headspace, but it also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for 'lighter' esters like DMP and DEP. 
           The optimal temperature range is between 40-100°C, with a maximum extraction efficiency reached at around 70°C for 'heavier'   
           phthalate esters.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
           However, this answer specifically refers to Note1994 chunk 3. For the full context of SPME fibres in general (as presented by  
           Note 1994 chunk 2), it states that optimal temperatures range from 50°C to 90°C and a lower temperature was observed at 50°C,  
           with higher efficiency reached at 90°C for a certain time frame of 60 minutes.                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
           My reasoning process involves analyzing the given context to identify specific information related to the extraction           
           temperature's effect on SPME fibre efficiency. I considered both Note1994 chunk 3 (which only discusses a specific study) and  
           Note1994 chunk 2 (which provides more general information about optimal temperatures for SPME fibres in milk samples). By      
           combining these pieces of information, I can provide a comprehensive understanding of how extraction temperature affects the   
           efficiency of SPME fibres.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: The extraction temperature affects the efficiency of SPME fibres by increasing concentration of phthalate      
           esters with higher temperatures, but also reducing retaining power of coating materials.

           My reasoning process involves analyzing the provided context, specifically from Bibliography2024 chunk 3. In this section, it  
           is mentioned that the MDL in this study was calculated as three times the standard deviation of five replicated runs of spiked 
           samples at the lowest concentration of calibration curve. This information directly provides the calculation method for the

           at the lowest concentration of calibration curve.

           Answer: To answer this question, I'll first define Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs):                                      
                                                                                                                                          
           *   MIPs are a type of polymer that is created through a process called templating, where a molecule serves as a template to   
           create a cavity or shape within the polymer matrix.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
           Based on the provided context, there are no specific applications listed for Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs). However, in
           general practice, MIPs are used in various applications such as:                                                               
                                                                                                                                          
           *   Separation and purification: MIPs can be designed to selectively bind target molecules, making them useful for separation  
           and purification processes.                                                                                                    
           *   Sensing and detection: The high selectivity of MIPs makes them suitable for sensing and detection applications, including  
           biosensors and chemical sensors.                                                                                               
           *   Catalysis and catalytic separation: MIPs can be used as catalysts or to enhance the efficiency of catalytic separation     
           processes.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
           Based on this general information about MIPs, their potential applications include:                                            
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) are used in separation and purification, sensing and detection, and      
           catalysis and catalytic separation processes due to their high selectivity.
