[18:56:29] Status: Paper Count=8 | Relevant Papers=2 | Current Evidence=8 | Current Cost=$0.0000                                          
           Answer: Nanosized materials have attracted attention due to their special features different from bulk materials, including    
           high activity and selectivity. This has led to the rapid development of chemical sensors based on these materials, which can   
           detect small concentrations of gas molecules with high sensitivity and specificity.                                            
                                                                                                                                          
           Reasoning process:                                                                                                             
           The question asks for the significance of nanosized materials in the development of chemical sensors. To answer this, I looked 
           for relevant information in the provided context, specifically focusing on passages that mention nanosized materials and their 
           applications. The first chunk from Zhang2174 mentions the unique features of nanosized materials and their use in chemical     
           sensors, indicating a direct connection between these materials and sensor development.                                        
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: Nanosized materials are significant in chemical sensor development due to their high activity and selectivity, 
           enabling the detection of small gas molecule concentrations with high sensitivity and specificity.
