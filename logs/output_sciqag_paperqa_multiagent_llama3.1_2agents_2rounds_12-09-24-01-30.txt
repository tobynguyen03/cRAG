           Answer: **Answer:** Phthalate esters have been linked to various health problems due to their endocrine-disrupting properties and ability to cause reproductive effects in mammals. They can leach into food and    
           water, causing exposure concerns. The potential health impacts of phthalate esters include estrogenic activity, which could lead to a range of health issues.                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **Reasoning:** Based on the context provided, it is clear that phthalate esters have been identified as a concern for human health due to their ability to mimic estrogen in the body and cause reproductive        
           effects. The European Commission's proposal to ban their use in soft PVC materials for baby toys further emphasizes the potential risks associated with these chemicals.                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **Agent 2 Summary:**                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           * Agent 1 Answer: Phthalate esters have been linked to various health problems due to their endocrine-disrupting properties and ability to cause reproductive effects in mammals.                                   
           * Agent 1 Reasoning: The European Commission's proposal to ban phthalates in baby toys, combined with studies showing estrogenic activity and potential for human exposure, supports the conclusion that these      
           chemicals pose a risk to human health.                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           **Agent 3 Summary:**                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           * Agent 2 Answer: Phthalate esters have been linked to various health problems due to their endocrine-disrupting properties and ability to cause reproductive effects in mammals.                                   
           * Agent 2 Reasoning: The detection of phthalates in milk samples, combined with the potential for these chemicals to leach into food and water, supports the conclusion that they pose a risk to human health.
