           Answer: The extraction temperature significantly affects the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre. For 'heavier' phthalate  
           esters, the amount collected on the fibre is proportional to the sample temperature. However, for 'lighter' esters such as DMP 
           and DEP, the extracted amount reaches a maximum at around 70 Â°C and then decreases with further increases of sample            
           temperature.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
           According to Table 1 (summarizing the relative amount of phthalate esters collected on each fibre under different extraction   
           temperatures), varying the temperature can impact the extraction efficiency, with some fibres performing better at higher or   
           lower temperatures. The optimal extraction temperature was determined to be 90 Â°C, which balances the extraction efficiency for
           all targets.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: The extraction temperature affects the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre differently depending on the    
           type of phthalate ester; a temperature of 90 Â°C is optimal for balancing extraction efficiency for both 'heavier' and 'lighter'
           esters.
