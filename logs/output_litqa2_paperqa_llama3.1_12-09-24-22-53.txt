           Answer: Based on the provided context, specifically from Wu2022 pages 8-11, it is stated that "our method detected 12,309 mandarin-specific ILs (transposable element insertion loci)." This suggests that there are approximately    
           12,300 unique transposable element insertion loci in the mandarin genome.                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
           The other options provided do not match this information. Option C mentions 39, which refers to the number of mandarin transcriptomes used for analysis, but it is not a direct count of unique ILs. The remaining options (A, B, E,  
           F, G, H, I, and J) are not supported by the context.

           Answer: According to Kafri et al. (2023) Cell 186(1), 5638–5655, disruption of MTF1 expression in Chlamydomonas has a severe photosynthetic phenotype, resulting in depletion of the entire photosynthetic apparatus and most         
           chloroplast-expressed proteins (Kafri2023 pages 14-14). This was observed in proteomic experiments and validated by genetic rescue, which alleviated the growth defect and recovered expression of chloroplast-expressed proteins.    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
           Furthermore, a comparison of chloroplast-expressed protein levels to nucleus-expressed protein levels for photosynthetic complexes in the mtf1 mutant suggests that MTF1 plays a role in regulating the translation of certain subsets
           of chloroplast-expressed proteins (Kafri2023 pages 14-15). The median of 6 independent experiments showed a decrease in protein levels of chloroplast-expressed genes in mtf1 mutants compared to wild-type, and a detailed comparison

           Answer: Based on the provided context, particularly from Sunil2024 pages 10-10, it is evident that:                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
           Gene expression changes with aging in P. falciparum parasites. Specifically, for male parasites (LE gametocytes), gene expression remains high throughout their lifespan. In contrast, female parasites show a decrease in gene       
           expression as they age.                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
           This information directly supports option B: Gene expression increases for P. falciparum males and decreases for females with aging.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
           ANSWER SUMMARY: The correct answer is B) Gene expression increases for P. falciparum males and decreases for females with aging, based on the observation that male gametocytes show active transcription throughout their lifespan,  
           while female gametocytes' gene expression decreases as they age.

           Answer: According to the text, Bempegaldesleukin (NKTR-214) preferentially binds to the b1b2γ complex on cytotoxic T cells while reducing its affinity for the high-affinity heterotrimeric b1b2γ complex expressed by regulatory T   
           cells (Tregs). This characteristic allows it to selectively stimulate cytotoxic T cell activity without promoting Treg expansion and activation.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
           ANSWER SUMMARY: Bempegaldesleukin reduces Treg affinity for IL-2 by preferentially binding to the b1b2γ complex on cytotoxic T cells rather than the high-affinity heterotrimeric b1b2γ complex on Tregs.

           Answer: Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the number of clades of adenosine deaminases when grouped according to structure-based clustering. The texts mention various tables, figures, and details 
           related to RNA editing patterns and adenosine receptor structures but do not explicitly provide any information about clade numbers.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
           Given this lack of specific data on clades of adenosine deaminases within the context:
