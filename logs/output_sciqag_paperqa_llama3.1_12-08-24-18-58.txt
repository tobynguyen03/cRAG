           Answer: The SrCO3 material exhibits rapid response to ethanol vapor with wide linear response, high sensitivity, and satisfied 
           stability. It also shows high selectivity to ethanol without interference from gasoline, ammonia, or hydrogen.                 
                                                                                                                                          
           Upon examining the context, it is clear that the question pertains to the performance of the SrCO3 sensor in detecting ethanol 
           vapor. To derive an answer, I reviewed each chunk for relevant information:                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
           * Chunk 1 mentions chemiluminescence (CL) as a response mechanism when catalytically oxidized by oxygen.                       
           * Chunk 2 highlights rapid response time (peaks at 7 seconds), increased CL signal (three orders of magnitude), and            
           temperature-dependent behavior.                                                                                                
           * Chunk 3 discusses the calibration curve, detection limit (2.1 ppm), and flow rate dependence on the CL intensity.            
           * Chunk 4 compares SrCO3 to TiO2, stating that it exhibits better stability and durability.                                    
                                                                                                                                          
           Based on these points, I inferred that the SrCO3 material responds rapidly to ethanol vapor with high sensitivity and          
           selectivity, while maintaining stability over time.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: The SrCO3 material exhibits rapid response, high sensitivity, and satisfied stability when detecting ethanol   
           vapor.

[19:00:11] Starting paper search for 'selectivity of SrCO3 sensor for ethanol detection'.

           Status: Paper Count=8 | Relevant Papers=0 | Current Evidence=0 | Current Cost=$0.0000                                          
[19:00:12] Generating answer for 'How selective is the SrCO3 sensor for detecting ethanol among other gases?'.                            
[19:00:33] Status: Paper Count=8 | Relevant Papers=1 | Current Evidence=5 | Current Cost=$0.0000                                          
           Answer: The SrCO3 sensor shows excellent selectivity towards detecting ethanol among other gases. It exhibits high sensitivity 
           and specificity for ethanol detection, with minimal or no interference observed from foreign substances such as hydrocarbon,   
           gasoline, ammonia, hydrogen, and n-hexane.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
           My answer is derived from multiple chunks of text (Zhang2174 chunk 1, Zhang2174 chunk 5, Zhang2174 chunk 3, and Zhang2174 chunk
           4) that consistently report the sensor's high selectivity for ethanol detection. The key terms "selectivity," "sensitivity,"   
           and "specificity" are used to describe the sensor's performance in detecting ethanol among other gases. Specifically, chunks 1 
           and 5 mention that the sensor shows excellent analytical characteristics with high sensitivity and selectivity towards         
           detecting ethanol, while chunk 3 states that the sensor exhibits significantly higher sensitivity and selectivity to ethanol   
           compared to other gases such as n-hexane.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: The SrCO3 sensor is highly selective for detecting ethanol among other gases due to its unique properties as a 
           nanosized material and its ability to produce chemiluminescence (CL) upon the oxidation of ethanol.

           Answer: The SrCO3 sensor can endure for at least 100 hours in a continuous ethanol vapor introduction experiment.              
                                                                                                                                          
           My reasoning process involves analyzing Zhang2174 chunk 3, which explicitly states that "no obvious change in CL intensity was 
           found after 100 h reaction" with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of about 1.02%. This suggests that the sensor maintained  
           its stability and durability for at least 100 hours.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: The SrCO3 sensor endures for at least 100 hours in continuous ethanol vapor introduction, based on the stable  
           CL intensity observed after 100 h reaction with a low RSD.
