           Answer: The likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 involves the oxidation      
           processes of two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation: acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and ethylene (C2H4). The conversion
           of these intermediates increases with temperature, which is consistent with the observed increase in CL intensity.             
                                                                                                                                          
           My reasoning process began by analyzing Zhang2174 chunk 1, where the authors discuss the different CL phenomena and results    
           from gas chromatography (GC) experiments to propose a possible mechanism for the reaction of ethanol oxidation resulting in CL.
           They consider the formation of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and ethylene as intermediate products of ethanol oxidation.         
                                                                                                                                          
           In Zhang2174 chunk 3, it is mentioned that the CL intensity increases with temperature from 350 to 470 Â°C, but the S/N ratio   
           reaches a maximum at 380 Â°C, which suggests that higher temperatures may cause an increase in noise signal. This implies that  
           the mechanism involves a thermally-activated process.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          
           Furthermore, Zhang2174 chunk 4 suggests that electronically excited formaldehyde (HCHO)* may be a chemiluminescing species     
           common to all ozone-olefin reactions, but it is not detected in this experiment. However, the conversion of acetaldehyde and   
           ethylene intermediates increases with temperature, indicating that these species are likely responsible for the CL emission.   
                                                                                                                                          
           Based on the analysis, the mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 involves the        
           oxidation processes of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and ethylene (C2H4).                                                              
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: The likely mechanism for the CL emission involves the oxidation processes of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and ethylene
           (C2H4), which increase with temperature, resulting in a thermally-activated process.
