[20:16:07] Status: Paper Count=0 | Relevant Papers=0 | Current Evidence=0 | Current Cost=$0.0000                                                                                                                             
           Answer: Based on the provided context and summarizations from other agents, I can attempt to address the question.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
           The context mentions "Active olfactory receptor genes" and their potential increase in contacts with Greek island regions in mouse olfactory neurons. However, there is no direct information about this specific 
           phenomenon in the context.                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
           Agent 2's default answer is not relevant here as it does not provide any insight into the specific factor by which active olfactory receptor genes increase their contacts with Greek island regions.             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
           However, Agent 2 mentions that researchers have found a significant increase in olfactory receptors on mice when exposed to different environments. This information suggests that there may be an increase in the
           expression or activity of certain olfactory receptor genes in response to environmental stimuli, which could include exposure to Greek island regions.                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
           Given this context and the available options, I will rely on additional research to provide a more accurate answer. Unfortunately, without direct evidence, it is challenging to determine the specific factor by 
           which active olfactory receptor genes increase their contacts with Greek island regions.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
           ANSWER SUMMARY: Insufficient information to accurately determine the factor.

[20:16:09] Status: Paper Count=0 | Relevant Papers=0 | Current Evidence=0 | Current Cost=$0.0000                                                                                                                             
           Answer: To address this question, we must first define key terms:                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
           * Active olfactory receptor genes: These are genes that encode proteins responsible for detecting odorant molecules in the nasal cavity, leading to signaling in the brain.                                       
           * Olfactory neurons: These are specialized nerve cells in the nasal epithelium that transmit signals from sensory receptors to the central nervous system.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
           Given the lack of direct evidence or explicit context within the provided summarizations, it is impossible to determine a precise factor by which active olfactory receptor genes increase their contacts with    
           regions on Greek islands (presumably referring to a specific study or research). The only option that aligns with available data is "Insufficient information to answer this question," as the other options do   
           not have basis in the provided context or summarizations.                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
           ANSWER SUMMARY: Insufficient information exists to accurately determine the factor by which active olfactory receptor genes increase their contacts with Greek island regions.                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
           REASONING SUMMARY: The lack of direct evidence and explicit context within the provided summarizations renders it impossible to provide a precise answer.
