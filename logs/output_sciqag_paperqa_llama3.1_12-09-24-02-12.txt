[02:15:04] Generating answer for 'How were the absolute extraction efficiencies (AEEs) of the phthalate esters in milk samples            
           determined?'.

           Answer: The absolute extraction efficiencies (AEEs) of the phthalate esters in milk samples were determined using two main     
           methods:                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
           1. In Note1994 chunk 2, it is mentioned that commercially available Homo-milk sample was spiked with 2 μg of each phthalate    
           ester in 5 g of milk. The spiked sample was then subjected to headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) using different  
           commercially available SPME fibres under various extraction conditions.                                                        
           2. In Note1994 chunk 3, it is mentioned that the relative amount of phthalate esters collected on each fibre was normalized to 
           the highest extracted amount among all phthalate esters.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                          
           In both cases, the AEEs were determined based on the comparison of the relative amounts of phthalate esters collected on each  
           fibre. Additionally, in Note1994 chunk 5, it is mentioned that the AEEs of phthalate esters in milk samples were calculated    
           using the best curve fitting equations for all the phthalate esters listed.                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
           The reasoning process involved analyzing each note to understand how the AEEs were determined. In Note1994 chunk 2, it was     
           clear that the AEEs were determined by comparing the relative amounts of phthalate esters collected on each fibre. In Note1994 
           chunk 3, it was mentioned that the extraction efficiency was evaluated at two temperatures: 90 °C for 60 min, and 50 °C, which 
           suggests that the AEEs may have been estimated or calculated based on the response of calibration standard solutions in the    
           GC-MS analysis.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: The absolute extraction efficiencies (AEEs) of phthalate esters in milk samples were determined by comparing   
           the relative amounts of phthalate esters collected on each fibre, using commercially available SPME fibres and varying         
           extraction conditions.

           Generating answer for 'What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?'.                             
[02:15:40] Status: Paper Count=3 | Relevant Papers=1 | Current Evidence=4 | Current Cost=$0.0000                                          
           Answer: Internal standards, specifically DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4, play a crucial role in the accurate quantification of phthalate   
           esters. They are used to normalize peak area counts of chromatograms, ensuring the accuracy of the analysis and accounting for 
           any variations in the extraction process. Internal standards help identify true positives by comparing ion ratios against those
           of associated standards. Additionally, they enable the use of one-point standard addition to calculate the concentration of    
           target analytes, correcting for differences in extraction efficiency due to variations in fat content in milk samples.         
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: Internal standards (DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4) are used to accurately quantify phthalate esters by normalizing peak   
           area counts, identifying true positives, and correcting for extraction efficiency.

           paper_search for query 'diabetic rat model study' and offset 0 returned 7 papers.                                              
           Status: Paper Count=7 | Relevant Papers=0 | Current Evidence=0 | Current Cost=$0.0000                                          
[02:25:05] Generating answer for 'How was the diabetic rat model established in this study?'.                                             
[02:25:31] Status: Paper Count=7 | Relevant Papers=2 | Current Evidence=8 | Current Cost=$0.0000                                          
           Answer: The diabetic rat model was established using an intraperitoneal dose of 50 mg/kg Streptozotocin (STZ) administered to  
           female Sprague–Dawley rats. The rats were monitored for glucose levels, and those with blood glucose levels exceeding 200 mg/dl
           after 4 days were considered diabetic.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                          
           My reasoning process involved analyzing the provided context from Huang2021 chunk 1, which explicitly stated that the diabetic 
           rat model was established using STZ administration. This information directly answers the question about how the diabetic rat  
           model was established in this study.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                          
           ANSWER SUMMARY: The diabetic rat model was established through intraperitoneal STZ administration to Sprague–Dawley rats with a
           blood glucose level exceeding 200 mg/dl after 4 days indicating diabetes.
