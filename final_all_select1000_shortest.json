Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting from the selective destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets . It is growing in incidence and currently affects roughly 0.5% of the population in developed countries . Despite the vast understanding of its epidemiology, a definite solution for the prevention of type 1 diabetes or its deleterious effects is still not forthcoming. Causes of diabetes are believed to be associated with genetics, environmental factors, nutritional effects, or a combination of these. Many experimental studies have used simulated diabetes on animal models to understand the molecular events associated with this disease and its complications . Streptozotocin (STZ) 1 is well known to induce diabetogenic action by the selective destruction of pancreatic beta cells, and it is the most frequently used model for inducing diabetes mellitus . The STZ-induced diabetic rat model provides a good platform to investigate diabetes using new approaches that may provide additional information on and insight into the mechanisms and effects of the disease.\nThe rapidly growing field of metabolomics (or metabonomics) that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations provides a wealth of biological information on complex systems . It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer , type 2 diabetes , and inborn errors of metabolism , and it has been used to study the effects of diet , drugs , toxins , and stress . Metabolomics combines data-rich advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis (MSA). NMR-based metabolomics is capable of simultaneously detecting a wide variety of extracellular (and intracellular in the case of tissue) metabolites that provide information on a large number of normal and abnormal biochemical pathways. To date, NMR spectroscopy has been applied to a number of diabetes studies . NMR spectroscopy provides very high quantitative accuracy and reproducibility; is nondestructive, cost-effective, and rapid (typical requirements are a few minutes/sample); and requires limited or no sample preparation .\nNMR data in combination with MSA allow the identification of potential biomarkers in biological specimens and an improved ability to identify specific metabolic pathways and networks associated with disease . Widely used MSA methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) discriminant analysis are applied for disease classification (through the use of scores plots) and biomarker detection (through the use of loadings plots) . The computation of the correlation among the detected metabolites can be used to study biological networks in metabolomics ; however, such approaches remain at a preliminary stage. In principle, the application of the correlation matrix is straightforward and holds a great deal of promise for tracing specific metabolic pathways to investigate metabolic disturbances due to disease or other effects.\nThis study aimed to identify disturbed metabolic pathways in STZ-induced diabetes using a 1H NMR-based metabolomics approach. Absolute changes in the daily excreted quantities of detected metabolites (diabetic vs. control) and changes in the correlations among detected metabolites (for diabetic and control separately) were investigated. An integrated evaluation of metabolic changes in both quantities and correlations allowed us to trace specific disturbances in the metabolic pathways most associated with induced type 1 diabetes. We also compared our findings with current hypotheses regarding the detailed diabetes biochemistry.\n3-(Trimethylsilyl)propionic acid\u2013d4 sodium salt (TSP), \u03b1-tocopherol (all-rac), STZ, 2-thiobarbituric, d-(+)-glucose, ethanol, sodium pyruvate, sodium fumarate dibasic, allantoin, and sodium azide were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and were used without further purification.\nFemale rats (Sprague\u2013Dawley strain from the animal quarters located at San Pablo\u2013CEU University), all similar in development stage (12 \u00b1 2 weeks), were studied. The diabetic group (n = 8) consisted of animals that received an intraperitoneal dose (50 mg/kg) of STZ and showed glucose levels in the blood of more than 200 mg/dl after 4 days. The control group (n = 10) consisted of age- and gender-matched rats. Throughout the study, both diabetic and control animals were kept under appropriate conditions (22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C temperature and 55 \u00b1 10% relative humidity). Air was replaced with adequate frequency, and the rats were maintained under a 12-h light\u2013darkness cycle. Animals were housed in collective cages (1820 cm3, not more than 6 animals per cage) with a bed of poplar shaving (29/12, Souralit, Spain), and all had free access to tap water and food (Harlan Global Diet 2014, Harlan Interfauna Ib\u00e9rica, Madrid, Spain). Seven days after STZ administration, the rats were housed in metabolic cages and urine was collected and pooled every 8 h. Urine collection tubes contained hydrogen chloride (0.1 M) to avoid bacterial contamination. The total volume of urine for each rat excreted in 24 h was measured and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Urine samples were transported to Purdue University by air carrier over dry ice for metabolomics studies. On the day of sacrifice, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (75\u2013100 mg/kg)/azepromacine (2.5 mg/ml) and blood was obtained by cardiac puncture in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The study was approved by the ethics committee of the San Pablo\u2013CEU University (RD 223/1988) and is in agreement with Amsterdam Treaty and Spanish legislation.\nPlasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and urea were analyzed using commercial kits from Spinreact (Gerona, Spain). Thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) were measured according to Viana and coworkers .\nFrozen urine samples were thawed, and 500 \u03bcl was mixed with phosphate buffer (75 \u03bcl, 0.5 M, pH 7.0), D2O (75 \u03bcl), TSP (5 \u03bcl in D2O, 0.11 \u03bcmol), and sodium azide (5 \u03bcl in D2O, 12.3 nmol). Resulting solutions were centrifuged to remove particulate matter, if any, and 500 \u03bcl of the supernatants was transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes. All 1H NMR experiments were carried out at 25 \u00b0C on a Bruker DRX 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with an HCN 1H inverse detection probe with triple axis magnetic field gradients. 1H NMR spectra were acquired using the standard one-dimensional NOESY pulse sequence with water presaturation during the recycle delay of 3 s and a mixing time of 100 ms. Each dataset was averaged over 32 transients using 32,000 time domain points. The data were Fourier transformed after multiplying by an exponential window function with a line broadening of 0.3 Hz, and the spectra were phase and baseline corrected using Bruker XWinNMR software (version 3.5).\nA total of 17 metabolites were identified in the 1H NMR spectra based on their characteristic chemical shifts and multiplicities. Individual metabolite quantities were then calculated by spectral integration of the full resolution data, taking into account the NMR signal intensity and number of protons that contributed to the measured NMR signals for both metabolites and the reference, TSP, and corrected using the total volume of urine excreted in 24 h.\nEach NMR data set was binned to 4096 points (bin size 0.003 ppm) to minimize the effects of pH and ionic concentration differences. The data were aligned with reference to the TSP signal, and the regions containing TSP, urea, and residual water (4.6\u20135.3 ppm) signals were removed. Each NMR data set was then appropriately multiplied using the total 24-h urine volume. The data were mean-centered and divided by the square root of the standard deviation (Pareto scaling) to emphasize both large- and small-concentration metabolite signals. Subsequently, the data were subjected to unsupervised statistical analysis, PCA, using Pirouette software (version 3.11, Infometrix) to classify the samples (control or diabetic). P values for the individual metabolites were determined on the actual metabolite quantities using the unpaired t test available in the R software package (http://www.r-project.org). A Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction was applied to adjust the P values by accounting for the 17 metabolites used in the analysis. In addition, the Pearson\u2019s correlations among all of the metabolites (for diabetic and control samples separately) were also calculated using R. The statistical significance of the correlation coefficients was tested using a t test by giving a null hypothesis (H0) of r = 0, where r represents the correlation coefficient. If H0 holds, t=rn-21-r2 approximately follows the t distribution with degrees of freedom equal to n\u20132, where n represents the sample size. A low P value (<0.05) for this test means that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis or that there is a statistically significant relationship between the two variables (metabolites). Correspondingly, an absolute value of r larger than 0.6 (calculated for the control group) or 0.7 (calculated for the diabetic group) is considered as a statistically significant relationship between the two metabolites.\nSelected demographic and blood parameters determined by biochemical analysis of diabetic and control rat samples are shown in Table 1 . Mean values for plasma glucose, urea, \u03b1-tocopherol, TBARS, triglycerides, and liver \u03b1-tocopherol were higher in diabetes than control, whereas those for plasma protein and cholesterol were slightly lower. Diabetic rats consumed more water and excreted more than 10 times more urine (mean volume 129 \u00b1 39 ml) than control rats (mean volume 9.6 \u00b1 4.0 ml) in 24 h.\nTypical 1H NMR spectra of urine from a diabetic rat and a control rat are shown in Fig. 1 along with the metabolite assignments. Diabetic rat urine spectra contained very high-intensity signals arising from glucose. In addition, the spectra contained numerous signals from the following small molecules: alanine, lactate, ethanol, acetate, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, dimethylglycine, fumarate, succinate, citrate, formate, hippurate, urea, allantoin, dimethylamine, and creatinine. The assignments were made based on literature values , and tentative assignments made due to the overlap or slight shift in their positions (such as for glucose, ethanol, pyruvate, fumarate, and allantoin) were confirmed by rerecording 1H NMR spectra for urine before and after the addition of small quantities of the respective standard compounds obtained from commercial sources.\nTable 2 shows the metabolite mean quantities and standard deviations in both diabetic and control groups as well as P values between the two groups. Glucose excretion was enormous in diabetic rats, with the quantity being nearly 7500-fold higher than in control rats (P = 0.000099). The metabolite with the second highest increase was lactate, with the amount being nearly 40-fold higher in diabetes (P = 0.045). Other significantly enhanced metabolites were alanine, ethanol, acetate, and fumarate (P < 0.05). The average quantities of pyruvate, formate, succinate, and dimethylglycine were 2- to 4-fold higher in diabetes than in controls but were not statistically significant. 2-Oxoglutarate, citrate, hippurate, allantoin, dimethylamine, and creatinine did not show any large or significant differences (Ps = 0.089\u20130.97).\nThe PCA scores plot for the quantitative NMR data shows well-separated clusters for disease and control rats (Fig. 2 A) and a tight grouping of the control animals. The PC1 loadings plot (Fig. 2B) shows a large number of metabolites in addition to glucose that contributed to the separation. Supervised PLS discriminant analysis also was applied to the data after Pareto scaling and showed similar scores and loadings plots to those for PCA (Fig. S1 in Supplementary material). Although glucose signals dominate the loadings plot, other metabolites such as alanine, lactate, ethanol, acetate, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, dimethylglycine, succinate, formate, and allantoin show positive loadings (similar to glucose). Citrate, creatinine, and hippurate have negative loadings (opposite to glucose). Fumarate does not clearly show up in the PC1 loadings plot, possibly because it has a relatively small variance across all samples as well as a low concentration. The additional contribution of metabolites other than glucose was further demonstrated by performing PCA again (Fig. 2C and D) after removing the glucose region, and the scores plot still shows a clear separation between the diabetic and control rats.\nTo investigate relationships among the metabolites, their quantities were correlated separately for diabetic and control rats using Pearson\u2019s correlation (Fig. 3 ). Correlation coefficients range from 1.0 (maximum positive correlation) to \u22121.0 (maximum anticorrelation), with a value of 0 representing no correlation. It is clear from the comparison of the two correlation plots in Fig. 3 that the changes between the diabetic and control animals were minimal for the correlation of glucose with alanine, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, citrate, allantoin, and creatinine. In diabetic rats, the correlation of glucose with urea was increased dramatically from 0.3 to 1, whereas the correlation of glucose with lactate decreased from 0.6 to 0. The correlation of citrate with alanine, lactate, and succinate was decreased from 0.9 to 0.4, from 0.8 to \u22120.3, and from 0.8 to \u22120.5, respectively, whereas the correlation of citrate with pyruvate, fumarate, and urea increased. Several metabolites showed a high positive correlation with one another in both diabetes and controls. For example, the metabolite pairs of acetate and ethanol, 2-oxoglutarate and citrate, 2-oxoglutarate and creatinine, and allantoin and creatinine showed high correlation (R > 0.9). Overall, for control rats, most metabolites correlate with one another with high correlation coefficients, as indicated by the predominantly red and orange regions in Fig. 3A, except that acetate, ethanol, and formate are relatively isolated from other metabolites and show blue stripes (|R| < 0.4) in the correlation network. In contrast, the increased blue regions in Fig. 3B for the diabetic animals indicate that a number of correlations are significantly decreased and show an overall decrease in metabolic correlation.\nUpon STZ administration, plasma glucose showed elevated levels, with its quantity being nearly three times higher than in control rats, as anticipated. A number of other changes in blood parameters are also observed (Table 1). However, much more dramatic changes are seen in the urine, as indicated by the 1H NMR data. This is further shown using a quantitative metabolomics approach, in which a distinct classification of diabetic and normal rats is observed (Fig. 2A and B). Statistical analysis of the NMR data, even after removing the glucose signals, showed a number of metabolites contributing to the clear separation of diabetic animals from control animals (Fig. 2C and D). This is corroborated by the high metabolite mean ratios (>2) of 8 of the metabolites (Table 2). As described below, a detailed analysis of the metabolite correlation matrices (Fig. 3) in combination with their altered metabolite levels indicates a significantly altered metabolism in the glucose metabolism and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles and the effect of gut microbial metabolism in rat diabetes. Fig. 4 compiles these observations based on the KEGG metabolic pathway database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html). Each metabolite is designated using a specific shape and is filled with a specific color to indicate correlations and altered quantities, respectively. Four types of shapes are used to indicate diverse correlations among the observed 17 metabolites, whereas the five different colors are used to indicate the changes in quantities of these metabolites. Three colored borders are used to differentiate the correlations with three key metabolites: glucose (blue), acetate (purple), and creatinine (pink). Black and purple arrows are used to differentiate mammalian pathways from bacterial pathways. The origin and implications of these relationships are discussed below in terms of the altered glucose metabolism, the TCA cycle, and symbiotic metabolism observed in this study.\nIncreased glucose in diabetes is due in large part to the enhanced endogenous glucose production (EGP) from noncarbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis) and the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis). It has been shown that glycogenolysis was the major factor causing EGP in early stage insulin deficiency . At a later stage, especially for type 1 diabetes, EGP is attributed mainly to gluconeogenesis fueled by amino acids from degraded protein or dietary ingestion. Although such findings are still somewhat in question due to the lack of reliability in the quantitative measurements , our studies support this hypothesis. In particular, significantly or moderately increased levels of alanine and urea with glucose in diabetes and their increased correlation with one another clearly suggest enhanced amino acids-fueled EGP in diabetes. The increased alanine concentration found in this study for the diabetic rats is in agreement with reports on human type 1 and type 2 diabetes . An observed increased correlation of glucose with alanine but not with lactate in diabetic rats suggests that the EGP might be associated more closely with amino acids than with lactate even though the EGP effect from lactate is normally double that arising from alanine . The observations of severely enhanced lactate in both diabetic urine (Table 2) and plasma indicate a significantly reduced consumption of lactate compared with its production. The association of EGP with protein/amino acid metabolism in diabetes was also evident from the observed urea changes. The increased urea average content in both plasma and urine (Tables 1 and 2) in the diabetic animals suggests an increasing nitrogen load to the liver where urea is formed. We observed remarkable changes in the relationship between urea and glucose; there is essentially no correlation between these two metabolites (R = 0.3) in the control animals, whereas a strikingly high correlation between glucose and urea (R = 1.0) develops in diabetes (Fig. 3). The correlation agrees with a known fact that the amino-acid-fueled EGP enhances the nitrogen load on the liver and, consequently, urea synthesis is closely related to glucose synthesis . Because we observed minimal loss of body mass, the high correlation between urea and glucose in diabetic samples more likely indicates that high glucose is fueled mainly by ingested amino acids along with likely reduced protein synthesis.\nA glucose homeostasis was observed in control rats from the positive correlation of glucose with both the gluconeogenesis precursors alanine, lactate, and pyruvate and the TCA cycle intermediates 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, succinate, and citrate. This can be explained by the fact that a good control of glucose catabolism and anabolism is highly associated with the glucose\u2013alanine and Cori (glucose\u2013lactate) cycles between peripheral tissues and the liver, as demonstrated in Fig. 4. Both lactate and alanine are formed peripherally by glucose-derived pyruvate and are transported to the liver, where their carbon skeleton is reconverted to glucose. The maintenance of glucose homeostasis also demands a well-functioned TCA cycle capable of producing gluconeogenesis precursors and facilitating glucose oxidation. In addition to the observation that glucose correlates with the identified TCA cycle, it was found from our study that pyruvate (the glycolytic end product that enters the TCA cycle) correlates with the three detected TCA cycle intermediates: 2-oxoglurarate, fumarate, and citrate (Figs. 3A and 4). The metabolic profile from STZ-induced diabetes shows a dramatic perturbation of both glucose metabolism and the TCA cycle, as indicated in both Figs. 3B and 4. First, although glucose correlates highly with alanine, it fails to correlate with lactate (Fig. 3B), indicating that the Cori cycle might be perturbed. Second, the correlation of glucose with the TCA intermediates is markedly disturbed with decreasing or missing correlations with 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, and succinate. Third, the correlations among the TCA intermediates are also significantly altered; for example, succinate no longer correlates with 2-oxoglutarate and citrate in diabetic rats.\nAn accumulation of acetate in STZ-induced diabetic urine suggests a defective acetate switch, that is, the molecular switch that regulates the dissimilation and assimilation of acetate . The elevation of acetate indicates an increased acetyl\u2013coenzyme A (CoA) pool due to both exogenous (bacterial fermentation) and endogenous (mammalian) production . Mammalian up-regulation of acetyl\u2013CoA synthetase 2 (AceCS2) leads to an accumulation of acetate under ketogenic conditions . AceCS2 occurs in most organs but not in the liver, and its up-regulation in other organs stimulates liver excretion of acetate, which accumulates in the bloodstream . In addition, the reduced expression of mammalian AceCS1 (which converts acetate to acetyl\u2013CoA) might also contribute partially to acetate accumulation .\nThe observed correlations of acetate with ethanol, lactate, succinate, and formate suggest that the origin of these metabolites may be more microbial than mammalian. It is well known that gut bacteria produce these metabolites, and this evidence was also confirmed by an NMR study of gut fluid (jejunal aspirate) . Another in vitro 1H NMR spectroscopy study on bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae showed that the bacteria produced acetate, succinate, and ethanol in the presence of a carbon source such as glycerol . Furthermore, the quantity of these bacterial metabolites increased significantly with increasing bacterial count, establishing their link with the bacteria . The high correlation of acetate with succinate in diabetes (R = 1) versus their moderate correlation in controls (R = 0.6) is in agreement with the intestinal microbial overgrowth in STZ-induced rats . A strong association between acetate and ethanol was observed in both control and STZ rats. Detection of acetate and ethanol in the rat digestive tract was reported previously , and their enhancements in diabetes are consistent with our results. Alternatively, excess glucose can augment the carbon flux to the TCA cycle, inhibiting the expression of many TCA cycle enzymes and producing a number of partially oxidized metabolites (e.g., ethanol, lactate, formate, succinate). This situation is known as the bacterial Crabtree effect . In the current study, an explanation for the increased amounts of these bacterial metabolites in diabetic rat urine may be due to (i) an increase in bacterial metabolites produced in the gut of diabetic rats due to the microbial overgrowth, (ii) the Crabtree effect, or (iii) both effects (i) and (ii). Significant levels of bacterial metabolites observed in diabetic rats and their possible origin, gut microbes, could have significant implications for understanding and controlling the secondary effects of these acids on diabetic patients. However, a further investigation is needed to verify this microbial hypothesis.\nCholine is degraded via (i) mammalian pathways in which choline is converted to creatinine via dimethylglycine and (ii) symxenobiotic pathways in which choline is converted to methylamine by gut microbiota . A remarkable switch between dimethylglycine and dimethylamine was observed from our study. In controls, dimethylamine correlates highly with glucose, alanine, fumarate, and creatinine, whereas dimethylglycine fails to correlate with these metabolites. In diabetes, on the contrary, dimethyglycine correlates highly with glucose, alanine, fumarate, and creatinine, whereas dimethylamine fails to correlate with these metabolites. The reasons causing such a correlative switch are still unclear at this stage. The significant enhancement of dimethylglycine observed in STZ\u2013diabetic rats may suggest an increased mammalian uptake of dietary choline. Alternatively, an enhanced conversion of choline to dimethylglycine may occur as compared with its conversions to dimethylamine (no observed difference between control and diabetes) or phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 4). The altered choline metabolism could be accounted for by the elevation of plasma triglycerides and liver weight in diabetic rats, as observed from our study (Table 1). High blood glucose levels in the presence of even low insulin levels stimulate the hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis . Insufficient conversion of choline to phosphatidylcholine exacerbates fatty liver and results in accumulation of triglycerides in plasma . It is possible that the conversion of choline to phosphatidylcholine was reduced due to its potentially enhanced conversion to dimethyglycine in diabetic rats. More studies are required to understand in detail the specific reasons for such a switch in the correlations among the metabolites of the choline pathway.\nElevation of lactate and pyruvate from the STZ\u2013diabetic rats indicates an increased glycolysis. Because muscle cells in these STZ rats will be glucose starved and would likely oxidize all of the carbon from glucose through oxidative phosphorylation, the high levels of pyruvate and lactate might instead stem from glycolic production of lactate at the level of the red blood cells (RBCs) , which express a variant of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. It is also possible that other non-insulin-sensitive tissues are metabolizing glucose to lactate, which can be interconverted to pyruvate. This pathway may provide a good compensatory mechanism given that the monocarboxylase transporters, which carry lactate into and out of muscle cells, are not insulin sensitive. Thus, lactate would enter the cell and be converted to pyruvate. However, this scenario does not rule out the possibility of a gut microbial production contribution to the enhanced lactate and pyruvate concentrations. Further investigations need to be carried out to discern the origin of accumulated lactate and pyruvate.\nThe TBARS concentration in plasma has been used as an oxidative stress biomarker associated with the presence and amount of final fat degradation products induced by free radicals, and it has been shown to be increased in diabetes and to decrease after treatment with antioxidants . This parameter has been highly criticized because of its lack of specificity , and although it should not be used alone to reach conclusions, it may add information if used in combination with other oxidative stress biomarkers.\nIn conclusion, this NMR-based metabolomics approach is useful for the identification and quantitation of high-concentration but important metabolites, and it provides significant information for improving the understanding of disease through the identification of altered metabolic pathways and networks. The urinary metabolites show dramatic changes in this rat diabetic model when compared with blood-based assays. Correlations among the detected metabolites show a number of striking differences between the diabetic and control rats. Metabolomics-based approaches that identify altered mammalian and symbiotic pathways observed in induced diabetes in rats will be useful for providing additional detailed knowledge concerning metabolic pathways associated with diabetes. Application of these methods to human diabetic patients and a comparison with the derived metabolite and pathway correlations may provide information for identifying additional factors associated with molecular genesis of diabetes and oxidative stress.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting from the selective destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets . It is growing in incidence and currently affects roughly 0.5% of the population in developed countries . Despite the vast understanding of its epidemiology, a definite solution for the prevention of type 1 diabetes or its deleterious effects is still not forthcoming. Causes of diabetes are believed to be associated with genetics, environmental factors, nutritional effects, or a combination of these. Many experimental studies have used simulated diabetes on animal models to understand the molecular events associated with this disease and its complications . Streptozotocin (STZ) 1 is well known to induce diabetogenic action by the selective destruction of pancreatic beta cells, and it is the most frequently used model for inducing diabetes mellitus . The STZ-induced diabetic rat model provides a good platform to investigate diabetes using new approaches that may provide additional information on and insight into the mechanisms and effects of the disease.\nThe rapidly growing field of metabolomics (or metabonomics) that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations provides a wealth of biological information on complex systems . It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer , type 2 diabetes , and inborn errors of metabolism , and it has been used to study the effects of diet , drugs , toxins , and stress . Metabolomics combines data-rich advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis (MSA). NMR-based metabolomics is capable of simultaneously detecting a wide variety of extracellular (and intracellular in the case of tissue) metabolites that provide information on a large number of normal and abnormal biochemical pathways. To date, NMR spectroscopy has been applied to a number of diabetes studies . NMR spectroscopy provides very high quantitative accuracy and reproducibility; is nondestructive, cost-effective, and rapid (typical requirements are a few minutes/sample); and requires limited or no sample preparation .\nNMR data in combination with MSA allow the identification of potential biomarkers in biological specimens and an improved ability to identify specific metabolic pathways and networks associated with disease . Widely used MSA methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) discriminant analysis are applied for disease classification (through the use of scores plots) and biomarker detection (through the use of loadings plots) . The computation of the correlation among the detected metabolites can be used to study biological networks in metabolomics ; however, such approaches remain at a preliminary stage. In principle, the application of the correlation matrix is straightforward and holds a great deal of promise for tracing specific metabolic pathways to investigate metabolic disturbances due to disease or other effects.\nThis study aimed to identify disturbed metabolic pathways in STZ-induced diabetes using a 1H NMR-based metabolomics approach. Absolute changes in the daily excreted quantities of detected metabolites (diabetic vs. control) and changes in the correlations among detected metabolites (for diabetic and control separately) were investigated. An integrated evaluation of metabolic changes in both quantities and correlations allowed us to trace specific disturbances in the metabolic pathways most associated with induced type 1 diabetes. We also compared our findings with current hypotheses regarding the detailed diabetes biochemistry.\n3-(Trimethylsilyl)propionic acid\u2013d4 sodium salt (TSP), \u03b1-tocopherol (all-rac), STZ, 2-thiobarbituric, d-(+)-glucose, ethanol, sodium pyruvate, sodium fumarate dibasic, allantoin, and sodium azide were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and were used without further purification.\nFemale rats (Sprague\u2013Dawley strain from the animal quarters located at San Pablo\u2013CEU University), all similar in development stage (12 \u00b1 2 weeks), were studied. The diabetic group (n = 8) consisted of animals that received an intraperitoneal dose (50 mg/kg) of STZ and showed glucose levels in the blood of more than 200 mg/dl after 4 days. The control group (n = 10) consisted of age- and gender-matched rats. Throughout the study, both diabetic and control animals were kept under appropriate conditions (22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C temperature and 55 \u00b1 10% relative humidity). Air was replaced with adequate frequency, and the rats were maintained under a 12-h light\u2013darkness cycle. Animals were housed in collective cages (1820 cm3, not more than 6 animals per cage) with a bed of poplar shaving (29/12, Souralit, Spain), and all had free access to tap water and food (Harlan Global Diet 2014, Harlan Interfauna Ib\u00e9rica, Madrid, Spain). Seven days after STZ administration, the rats were housed in metabolic cages and urine was collected and pooled every 8 h. Urine collection tubes contained hydrogen chloride (0.1 M) to avoid bacterial contamination. The total volume of urine for each rat excreted in 24 h was measured and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Urine samples were transported to Purdue University by air carrier over dry ice for metabolomics studies. On the day of sacrifice, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (75\u2013100 mg/kg)/azepromacine (2.5 mg/ml) and blood was obtained by cardiac puncture in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The study was approved by the ethics committee of the San Pablo\u2013CEU University (RD 223/1988) and is in agreement with Amsterdam Treaty and Spanish legislation.\nPlasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and urea were analyzed using commercial kits from Spinreact (Gerona, Spain). Thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) were measured according to Viana and coworkers .\nFrozen urine samples were thawed, and 500 \u03bcl was mixed with phosphate buffer (75 \u03bcl, 0.5 M, pH 7.0), D2O (75 \u03bcl), TSP (5 \u03bcl in D2O, 0.11 \u03bcmol), and sodium azide (5 \u03bcl in D2O, 12.3 nmol). Resulting solutions were centrifuged to remove particulate matter, if any, and 500 \u03bcl of the supernatants was transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes. All 1H NMR experiments were carried out at 25 \u00b0C on a Bruker DRX 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with an HCN 1H inverse detection probe with triple axis magnetic field gradients. 1H NMR spectra were acquired using the standard one-dimensional NOESY pulse sequence with water presaturation during the recycle delay of 3 s and a mixing time of 100 ms. Each dataset was averaged over 32 transients using 32,000 time domain points. The data were Fourier transformed after multiplying by an exponential window function with a line broadening of 0.3 Hz, and the spectra were phase and baseline corrected using Bruker XWinNMR software (version 3.5).\nA total of 17 metabolites were identified in the 1H NMR spectra based on their characteristic chemical shifts and multiplicities. Individual metabolite quantities were then calculated by spectral integration of the full resolution data, taking into account the NMR signal intensity and number of protons that contributed to the measured NMR signals for both metabolites and the reference, TSP, and corrected using the total volume of urine excreted in 24 h.\nEach NMR data set was binned to 4096 points (bin size 0.003 ppm) to minimize the effects of pH and ionic concentration differences. The data were aligned with reference to the TSP signal, and the regions containing TSP, urea, and residual water (4.6\u20135.3 ppm) signals were removed. Each NMR data set was then appropriately multiplied using the total 24-h urine volume. The data were mean-centered and divided by the square root of the standard deviation (Pareto scaling) to emphasize both large- and small-concentration metabolite signals. Subsequently, the data were subjected to unsupervised statistical analysis, PCA, using Pirouette software (version 3.11, Infometrix) to classify the samples (control or diabetic). P values for the individual metabolites were determined on the actual metabolite quantities using the unpaired t test available in the R software package (http://www.r-project.org). A Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction was applied to adjust the P values by accounting for the 17 metabolites used in the analysis. In addition, the Pearson\u2019s correlations among all of the metabolites (for diabetic and control samples separately) were also calculated using R. The statistical significance of the correlation coefficients was tested using a t test by giving a null hypothesis (H0) of r = 0, where r represents the correlation coefficient. If H0 holds, t=rn-21-r2 approximately follows the t distribution with degrees of freedom equal to n\u20132, where n represents the sample size. A low P value (<0.05) for this test means that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis or that there is a statistically significant relationship between the two variables (metabolites). Correspondingly, an absolute value of r larger than 0.6 (calculated for the control group) or 0.7 (calculated for the diabetic group) is considered as a statistically significant relationship between the two metabolites.\nSelected demographic and blood parameters determined by biochemical analysis of diabetic and control rat samples are shown in Table 1 . Mean values for plasma glucose, urea, \u03b1-tocopherol, TBARS, triglycerides, and liver \u03b1-tocopherol were higher in diabetes than control, whereas those for plasma protein and cholesterol were slightly lower. Diabetic rats consumed more water and excreted more than 10 times more urine (mean volume 129 \u00b1 39 ml) than control rats (mean volume 9.6 \u00b1 4.0 ml) in 24 h.\nTypical 1H NMR spectra of urine from a diabetic rat and a control rat are shown in Fig. 1 along with the metabolite assignments. Diabetic rat urine spectra contained very high-intensity signals arising from glucose. In addition, the spectra contained numerous signals from the following small molecules: alanine, lactate, ethanol, acetate, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, dimethylglycine, fumarate, succinate, citrate, formate, hippurate, urea, allantoin, dimethylamine, and creatinine. The assignments were made based on literature values , and tentative assignments made due to the overlap or slight shift in their positions (such as for glucose, ethanol, pyruvate, fumarate, and allantoin) were confirmed by rerecording 1H NMR spectra for urine before and after the addition of small quantities of the respective standard compounds obtained from commercial sources.\nTable 2 shows the metabolite mean quantities and standard deviations in both diabetic and control groups as well as P values between the two groups. Glucose excretion was enormous in diabetic rats, with the quantity being nearly 7500-fold higher than in control rats (P = 0.000099). The metabolite with the second highest increase was lactate, with the amount being nearly 40-fold higher in diabetes (P = 0.045). Other significantly enhanced metabolites were alanine, ethanol, acetate, and fumarate (P < 0.05). The average quantities of pyruvate, formate, succinate, and dimethylglycine were 2- to 4-fold higher in diabetes than in controls but were not statistically significant. 2-Oxoglutarate, citrate, hippurate, allantoin, dimethylamine, and creatinine did not show any large or significant differences (Ps = 0.089\u20130.97).\nThe PCA scores plot for the quantitative NMR data shows well-separated clusters for disease and control rats (Fig. 2 A) and a tight grouping of the control animals. The PC1 loadings plot (Fig. 2B) shows a large number of metabolites in addition to glucose that contributed to the separation. Supervised PLS discriminant analysis also was applied to the data after Pareto scaling and showed similar scores and loadings plots to those for PCA (Fig. S1 in Supplementary material). Although glucose signals dominate the loadings plot, other metabolites such as alanine, lactate, ethanol, acetate, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, dimethylglycine, succinate, formate, and allantoin show positive loadings (similar to glucose). Citrate, creatinine, and hippurate have negative loadings (opposite to glucose). Fumarate does not clearly show up in the PC1 loadings plot, possibly because it has a relatively small variance across all samples as well as a low concentration. The additional contribution of metabolites other than glucose was further demonstrated by performing PCA again (Fig. 2C and D) after removing the glucose region, and the scores plot still shows a clear separation between the diabetic and control rats.\nTo investigate relationships among the metabolites, their quantities were correlated separately for diabetic and control rats using Pearson\u2019s correlation (Fig. 3 ). Correlation coefficients range from 1.0 (maximum positive correlation) to \u22121.0 (maximum anticorrelation), with a value of 0 representing no correlation. It is clear from the comparison of the two correlation plots in Fig. 3 that the changes between the diabetic and control animals were minimal for the correlation of glucose with alanine, pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, citrate, allantoin, and creatinine. In diabetic rats, the correlation of glucose with urea was increased dramatically from 0.3 to 1, whereas the correlation of glucose with lactate decreased from 0.6 to 0. The correlation of citrate with alanine, lactate, and succinate was decreased from 0.9 to 0.4, from 0.8 to \u22120.3, and from 0.8 to \u22120.5, respectively, whereas the correlation of citrate with pyruvate, fumarate, and urea increased. Several metabolites showed a high positive correlation with one another in both diabetes and controls. For example, the metabolite pairs of acetate and ethanol, 2-oxoglutarate and citrate, 2-oxoglutarate and creatinine, and allantoin and creatinine showed high correlation (R > 0.9). Overall, for control rats, most metabolites correlate with one another with high correlation coefficients, as indicated by the predominantly red and orange regions in Fig. 3A, except that acetate, ethanol, and formate are relatively isolated from other metabolites and show blue stripes (|R| < 0.4) in the correlation network. In contrast, the increased blue regions in Fig. 3B for the diabetic animals indicate that a number of correlations are significantly decreased and show an overall decrease in metabolic correlation.\nUpon STZ administration, plasma glucose showed elevated levels, with its quantity being nearly three times higher than in control rats, as anticipated. A number of other changes in blood parameters are also observed (Table 1). However, much more dramatic changes are seen in the urine, as indicated by the 1H NMR data. This is further shown using a quantitative metabolomics approach, in which a distinct classification of diabetic and normal rats is observed (Fig. 2A and B). Statistical analysis of the NMR data, even after removing the glucose signals, showed a number of metabolites contributing to the clear separation of diabetic animals from control animals (Fig. 2C and D). This is corroborated by the high metabolite mean ratios (>2) of 8 of the metabolites (Table 2). As described below, a detailed analysis of the metabolite correlation matrices (Fig. 3) in combination with their altered metabolite levels indicates a significantly altered metabolism in the glucose metabolism and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles and the effect of gut microbial metabolism in rat diabetes. Fig. 4 compiles these observations based on the KEGG metabolic pathway database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html). Each metabolite is designated using a specific shape and is filled with a specific color to indicate correlations and altered quantities, respectively. Four types of shapes are used to indicate diverse correlations among the observed 17 metabolites, whereas the five different colors are used to indicate the changes in quantities of these metabolites. Three colored borders are used to differentiate the correlations with three key metabolites: glucose (blue), acetate (purple), and creatinine (pink). Black and purple arrows are used to differentiate mammalian pathways from bacterial pathways. The origin and implications of these relationships are discussed below in terms of the altered glucose metabolism, the TCA cycle, and symbiotic metabolism observed in this study.\nIncreased glucose in diabetes is due in large part to the enhanced endogenous glucose production (EGP) from noncarbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis) and the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis). It has been shown that glycogenolysis was the major factor causing EGP in early stage insulin deficiency . At a later stage, especially for type 1 diabetes, EGP is attributed mainly to gluconeogenesis fueled by amino acids from degraded protein or dietary ingestion. Although such findings are still somewhat in question due to the lack of reliability in the quantitative measurements , our studies support this hypothesis. In particular, significantly or moderately increased levels of alanine and urea with glucose in diabetes and their increased correlation with one another clearly suggest enhanced amino acids-fueled EGP in diabetes. The increased alanine concentration found in this study for the diabetic rats is in agreement with reports on human type 1 and type 2 diabetes . An observed increased correlation of glucose with alanine but not with lactate in diabetic rats suggests that the EGP might be associated more closely with amino acids than with lactate even though the EGP effect from lactate is normally double that arising from alanine . The observations of severely enhanced lactate in both diabetic urine (Table 2) and plasma indicate a significantly reduced consumption of lactate compared with its production. The association of EGP with protein/amino acid metabolism in diabetes was also evident from the observed urea changes. The increased urea average content in both plasma and urine (Tables 1 and 2) in the diabetic animals suggests an increasing nitrogen load to the liver where urea is formed. We observed remarkable changes in the relationship between urea and glucose; there is essentially no correlation between these two metabolites (R = 0.3) in the control animals, whereas a strikingly high correlation between glucose and urea (R = 1.0) develops in diabetes (Fig. 3). The correlation agrees with a known fact that the amino-acid-fueled EGP enhances the nitrogen load on the liver and, consequently, urea synthesis is closely related to glucose synthesis . Because we observed minimal loss of body mass, the high correlation between urea and glucose in diabetic samples more likely indicates that high glucose is fueled mainly by ingested amino acids along with likely reduced protein synthesis.\nA glucose homeostasis was observed in control rats from the positive correlation of glucose with both the gluconeogenesis precursors alanine, lactate, and pyruvate and the TCA cycle intermediates 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, succinate, and citrate. This can be explained by the fact that a good control of glucose catabolism and anabolism is highly associated with the glucose\u2013alanine and Cori (glucose\u2013lactate) cycles between peripheral tissues and the liver, as demonstrated in Fig. 4. Both lactate and alanine are formed peripherally by glucose-derived pyruvate and are transported to the liver, where their carbon skeleton is reconverted to glucose. The maintenance of glucose homeostasis also demands a well-functioned TCA cycle capable of producing gluconeogenesis precursors and facilitating glucose oxidation. In addition to the observation that glucose correlates with the identified TCA cycle, it was found from our study that pyruvate (the glycolytic end product that enters the TCA cycle) correlates with the three detected TCA cycle intermediates: 2-oxoglurarate, fumarate, and citrate (Figs. 3A and 4). The metabolic profile from STZ-induced diabetes shows a dramatic perturbation of both glucose metabolism and the TCA cycle, as indicated in both Figs. 3B and 4. First, although glucose correlates highly with alanine, it fails to correlate with lactate (Fig. 3B), indicating that the Cori cycle might be perturbed. Second, the correlation of glucose with the TCA intermediates is markedly disturbed with decreasing or missing correlations with 2-oxoglutarate, fumarate, and succinate. Third, the correlations among the TCA intermediates are also significantly altered; for example, succinate no longer correlates with 2-oxoglutarate and citrate in diabetic rats.\nAn accumulation of acetate in STZ-induced diabetic urine suggests a defective acetate switch, that is, the molecular switch that regulates the dissimilation and assimilation of acetate . The elevation of acetate indicates an increased acetyl\u2013coenzyme A (CoA) pool due to both exogenous (bacterial fermentation) and endogenous (mammalian) production . Mammalian up-regulation of acetyl\u2013CoA synthetase 2 (AceCS2) leads to an accumulation of acetate under ketogenic conditions . AceCS2 occurs in most organs but not in the liver, and its up-regulation in other organs stimulates liver excretion of acetate, which accumulates in the bloodstream . In addition, the reduced expression of mammalian AceCS1 (which converts acetate to acetyl\u2013CoA) might also contribute partially to acetate accumulation .\nThe observed correlations of acetate with ethanol, lactate, succinate, and formate suggest that the origin of these metabolites may be more microbial than mammalian. It is well known that gut bacteria produce these metabolites, and this evidence was also confirmed by an NMR study of gut fluid (jejunal aspirate) . Another in vitro 1H NMR spectroscopy study on bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae showed that the bacteria produced acetate, succinate, and ethanol in the presence of a carbon source such as glycerol . Furthermore, the quantity of these bacterial metabolites increased significantly with increasing bacterial count, establishing their link with the bacteria . The high correlation of acetate with succinate in diabetes (R = 1) versus their moderate correlation in controls (R = 0.6) is in agreement with the intestinal microbial overgrowth in STZ-induced rats . A strong association between acetate and ethanol was observed in both control and STZ rats. Detection of acetate and ethanol in the rat digestive tract was reported previously , and their enhancements in diabetes are consistent with our results. Alternatively, excess glucose can augment the carbon flux to the TCA cycle, inhibiting the expression of many TCA cycle enzymes and producing a number of partially oxidized metabolites (e.g., ethanol, lactate, formate, succinate). This situation is known as the bacterial Crabtree effect . In the current study, an explanation for the increased amounts of these bacterial metabolites in diabetic rat urine may be due to (i) an increase in bacterial metabolites produced in the gut of diabetic rats due to the microbial overgrowth, (ii) the Crabtree effect, or (iii) both effects (i) and (ii). Significant levels of bacterial metabolites observed in diabetic rats and their possible origin, gut microbes, could have significant implications for understanding and controlling the secondary effects of these acids on diabetic patients. However, a further investigation is needed to verify this microbial hypothesis.\nCholine is degraded via (i) mammalian pathways in which choline is converted to creatinine via dimethylglycine and (ii) symxenobiotic pathways in which choline is converted to methylamine by gut microbiota . A remarkable switch between dimethylglycine and dimethylamine was observed from our study. In controls, dimethylamine correlates highly with glucose, alanine, fumarate, and creatinine, whereas dimethylglycine fails to correlate with these metabolites. In diabetes, on the contrary, dimethyglycine correlates highly with glucose, alanine, fumarate, and creatinine, whereas dimethylamine fails to correlate with these metabolites. The reasons causing such a correlative switch are still unclear at this stage. The significant enhancement of dimethylglycine observed in STZ\u2013diabetic rats may suggest an increased mammalian uptake of dietary choline. Alternatively, an enhanced conversion of choline to dimethylglycine may occur as compared with its conversions to dimethylamine (no observed difference between control and diabetes) or phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 4). The altered choline metabolism could be accounted for by the elevation of plasma triglycerides and liver weight in diabetic rats, as observed from our study (Table 1). High blood glucose levels in the presence of even low insulin levels stimulate the hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis . Insufficient conversion of choline to phosphatidylcholine exacerbates fatty liver and results in accumulation of triglycerides in plasma . It is possible that the conversion of choline to phosphatidylcholine was reduced due to its potentially enhanced conversion to dimethyglycine in diabetic rats. More studies are required to understand in detail the specific reasons for such a switch in the correlations among the metabolites of the choline pathway.\nElevation of lactate and pyruvate from the STZ\u2013diabetic rats indicates an increased glycolysis. Because muscle cells in these STZ rats will be glucose starved and would likely oxidize all of the carbon from glucose through oxidative phosphorylation, the high levels of pyruvate and lactate might instead stem from glycolic production of lactate at the level of the red blood cells (RBCs) , which express a variant of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. It is also possible that other non-insulin-sensitive tissues are metabolizing glucose to lactate, which can be interconverted to pyruvate. This pathway may provide a good compensatory mechanism given that the monocarboxylase transporters, which carry lactate into and out of muscle cells, are not insulin sensitive. Thus, lactate would enter the cell and be converted to pyruvate. However, this scenario does not rule out the possibility of a gut microbial production contribution to the enhanced lactate and pyruvate concentrations. Further investigations need to be carried out to discern the origin of accumulated lactate and pyruvate.\nThe TBARS concentration in plasma has been used as an oxidative stress biomarker associated with the presence and amount of final fat degradation products induced by free radicals, and it has been shown to be increased in diabetes and to decrease after treatment with antioxidants . This parameter has been highly criticized because of its lack of specificity , and although it should not be used alone to reach conclusions, it may add information if used in combination with other oxidative stress biomarkers.\nIn conclusion, this NMR-based metabolomics approach is useful for the identification and quantitation of high-concentration but important metabolites, and it provides significant information for improving the understanding of disease through the identification of altered metabolic pathways and networks. The urinary metabolites show dramatic changes in this rat diabetic model when compared with blood-based assays. Correlations among the detected metabolites show a number of striking differences between the diabetic and control rats. Metabolomics-based approaches that identify altered mammalian and symbiotic pathways observed in induced diabetes in rats will be useful for providing additional detailed knowledge concerning metabolic pathways associated with diabetes. Application of these methods to human diabetic patients and a comparison with the derived metabolite and pathway correlations may provide information for identifying additional factors associated with molecular genesis of diabetes and oxidative stress."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nNanosized materials have attracted widespread attention for their special features different from bulk materials since 1990s. Because of their high activity, good selectivity and small size, chemical sensors based on nanosized materials have been developed rapidly. For example, the individual semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT)-based chemical sensors capable of detecting small concentrations of gas molecules have been realized . Boron-doped silicon nanowire nanosensors have showed highly sensitive and selective detection of biological and chemical species . Palladium mesowire arrays for detection of hydrogen has been described based upon resistivity changes caused by the changes in the structure of the wire itself .\nSensing gas molecules is critical to industry monitoring, control of chemical processes, medical applications, environmental processes, and so on. The detection and quantification of ethanol, for instance, with high sensitivity and selectivity are required in many different fields. One of the important applications is to aid police in apprehending drink-driving offenders as a breath analyzer. Blood ethanol concentration can also be determined from its concentration in breath, a blood/breath alcohol partition ratio of 2000 having been widely adopted . In certain industry areas, such as fermentation and distillation, the ethanol vapor concentration can reach toxic levels, causing inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane and conjunctiva, irritation of the skin. The maximum permitted concentration of ethanol vapor in the work place as defined by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is 1000 ppm.\nAn efficient way is therefore required for measuring gaseous substances, including ethanol vapor, with high sensitivity and selectivity. The alcohol sensors based on nanosized materials have been studied extensively by using electrochemical methods. Sensor materials including tin oxides , rare earth oxides and other ethanol-sensing semiconducting materials have been widely investigated. However, these sensors are also sensitive to some foreign substances, such as hydrocarbon, gasoline, ammonia and hydrogen, which unfortunately interfere with the alcohol detection. In addition, more and more attention was paid to gas sensors based on the optical properties of nanosized materials. For instance, porous-silicon ethanol sensor was developed based on the shift of the Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot fringes by using laser interferometry method . Quantitative detection utilizing the quenching of photoluminescence of porous-silicon by NOx, SO2 and organic compounds has been developed . Chemiluminescence (CL) generated on the surface of nanosized materials was firstly observed during the mixture of porous-silicon and nitric acid , but no further analytical application based on the phenomenon has been developed. In recent years, Nakagawa and coworkers observed CL phenomena during the catalytic oxidation of organic vapors on the bulk materials of \u03b3-aluminum oxide (\u03b3-Al2O3) and \u03b3-Al2O3 activated by Dy3+ . However, their research work utilizing this kind of luminescence was limited to the two bulk solids. Strong CL observed from organic gases oxidized on six nanosized materials was firstly reported in our previous work . The details regarding analytical characteristics of the sensors were not involved in the paper since it is the very preliminary work. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the potentials of this new type of sensor based on nanosized SrCO3 material for the detection of ethanol by means of sensitivity, selectivity and lifetime as evaluation parameters. Nanosized SrCO3 was selected because this material showed excellent analytical characteristics over other five materials.\nThe possible mechanism of CL from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 has been studied in the paper by using gas chromatography (GC). As we know, the mechanism of gas-phase CL from the oxidation of some organic and inorganic gases by O3 has been studied intensively, such as NO+O3, SO+O3, unsaturated hydrocarbons + O3, etc. , which has been reviewed in a book . However, the CL mechanism about gases oxidized on solid catalysts was little studied except for several reports . Only one mechanism mode of CL from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on bulk material of \u03b3-Al2O3 was proposed, which attributed CL species to formaldehyde produced by the oxidation of ethylene that originated from ethanol . The following Eqs. (1) and (2) show the course of ethanol oxidation on \u03b3-Al2O3 resulted in the same CL phenomenon that has been observed during the oxidation of ethylene by O3 : C2H5OH\u2192C2H4+H2O 3C2H4+3O2\u21926HCHO+h\u03bd In this paper, however, CL can be found not only during the course of ethylene oxidation, but also from the oxidation of acetaldehyde that is another intermediate of the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3. According to the different CL phenomena not observed before and the results from GC experiments, the possible mechanism about the reaction of ethanol oxidation resulted in CL is discussed.\nThe CL detection system consists of a SrCO3 sensor and a commercial optical detector. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the SrCO3 sensor. It can be seen that a cylindrical ceramic heater of 5 mm diameter was put in a quartz tube of 12 mm inner diameter. This ceramic heater was operated at required temperature by using an electric wire inserted into the ceramic tube. Outside of the ceramic tube, a 0.5 mm layer of SrCO3 powder was sintered on the surface. The sample gas can flow only through the outside of ceramic heater because this ceramic tube is solid. The main reaction between sensor substrate and sample molecules occurred on the surface of nanosized SrCO3 powder. The CL intensity at a certain wavelength was measured with a BPCL Ultra Weak Chemiluminescence Analyzer (made by Biophysics Institute of Chinese Academy of Science in China) through variable optical filters. The SrCO3 sensor was heated at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min in air to avoid the influence of previous absorbates at the beginning of each series of experiments.\nA simple chemical precipitation method for the synthesis of nanosized SrCO3 was developed as follows: 0.1 M SrCl2 solution and 0.1 M Na2CO3 solution were firstly cooled to 2 \u00b0C. Then the Na2CO3 solution was rapidly added into the stirring SrCl2 solution at the ratios of 1:1. Immediately, the precipitation was filtered and washed with di-ionized water for five times. All of the chemicals used in the experiment were of analytical grade.\nThe topography and particle size of SrCO3 were measured using a Hitachi H-800 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The accelerating voltage of electron beam was 200 kV. Fig. 2 shows that the grain size of SrCO3 is about 60\u201370 nm. X-ray power diffraction (XRD) experiment was carried out in Rigaku DMAX-2400 diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. From Fig. 3 , we can find that these peaks are attributed to the pure strontianite-type crystal according to the XRD standard spectrum of SrCO3 crystal. The average crystal sizes can be determined from the XRD pattern parameters according to the Scherrer equation: D C=K \u03bb/\u03b2 cos \u03b8, where D C is the average crystal size, K is the Scherrer constant equal to 0.89, \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength equal to 0.1542 nm, \u03b2 is the full width at half-maximum and \u03b8 is the diffraction angle. The average size of SrCO3 crystal synthesized in this article is about 25 nm.\nIn order to investigate the catalytic reaction processes that involve CL emission, GC experiments were carried out to identify the intermediates from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3. The SP-502 GC instrument with a flame ionization detector (FID detector, made in Lunan Chemical Engineering & Instrument Company of P.R.C., equipped with a GDX403 column, size 1.5 m\u00d74 mm) was directly coupled to the CL detection system mentioned earlier for the rapid determination of intermediates from the ethanol oxidation. Products were identified by comparison of their retention time to that of the standard compounds from Huayuan Gas Cooperation in Beijing. The conditions for GC experiments were as follows: temperature of spray chamber operated at 120 \u00b0C, column temperature operated at 100 \u00b0C, pressure of carrier gas of Ar kept at 0.38 MPa.\nThe CL response profile of ethanol was studied by the injection of ethanol vapor with different concentrations into the carrier gas with a flow rate of 150 ml/min. Fig. 4 shows the CL response profiles of 70 ml ethanol vapor on the surface of nanosized SrCO3 at 380 \u00b0C with a bandpass filter of 425 nm. Curves 1\u20133 denote the results for different concentrations of 750, 1500 and 2250 ppm, respectively. The CL signal increased sharply by about three orders of magnitude after ethanol vapor was introduced. There is a systematic increase of CL intensity with the increasing ethanol concentration. Fig. 4 also shows that the peaks of each curve appear at 7 s after sample injection, which means rapid response of this sensor to ethanol, and the profiles are similar to each other. The half decay time of CL intensity of each curve is about 30 s. The decay is related to the luminescent product and the dead volume of the used instrument.\nFig. 5 shows the CL spectra emitted from the SrCO3 sensor during the process of catalytic oxidation of ethanol vapor at the flow rate of 150 ml/min. The temperature corresponding to curves 1\u20133 is 400, 380 and 350 \u00b0C, respectively. It can be seen that the profile of each curves in the figure are similar and each curves have the same peak at around 425, 460 and 530 nm, which means the same luminescent species was produced at different temperatures. But with the increasing of sensor temperature, the CL peak at 530 nm becomes higher than other two. This is to say, CL peak positions are independent of the tested temperatures that will affect the relative CL intensity.\nAs shown in Fig. 6 , the relative S/N (signal to background noise) ratios versus wavelength at three different temperatures are established. The profiles of curves 1\u20133 are similar to each other. It shows that there are also three peaks at the same positions with Fig. 5. The position of the highest peak is at 425 nm independent of temperature, which is different from Fig. 5. In fact, the background and noise signal at longer wavelength are much higher than those at short wavelength because of the incandescence of ceramic heater at high temperature. Although the CL signal is much higher at 530 nm than other wavelengths at 400 \u00b0C as shown in Fig. 5, the S/N value at 530 nm is still lower than that at 425 and 460 nm. From Fig. 6, the profiles of S/N ratios to wavelength are little affected by the tested temperatures. So, the wavelength of 425 nm is chosen for the further study of analytical characteristics.\nTemperature dependence of the CL intensity of 500 ppm ethanol was measured under the bandpass of 425 nm and at the flow rate of 150 ml/min. Fig. 7 denotes that the CL signal increases with the increase in temperature from 350 to 470 \u00b0C. It can be attributed to the higher conversion of ethanol on SrCO3 in high temperature, which will be explained later in the paper. However, according to the values of S/N versus temperature, the maximum value of S/N could be obtained when the sensor temperature is 380 \u00b0C; under or above the temperature causes decrease in the value of S/N. The reason is probably that the noise signal also increases with the temperature increasing, and even increases faster than the CL intensity at higher temperature. Therefore, the temperature of 380 \u00b0C was selected for the further work in the paper.\nThe flow rate dependence of the CL intensity at 425 nm was measured at 380 \u00b0C from 50 to 350 ml/min as illustrated in Fig. 8 . The CL intensity of 500 ppm ethanol increases with an increase in the flow rate, and it saturates above a certain flow rate F (280 ml/min). This directly shows that the catalytic oxidation process that produces the luminescent intermediates is under a diffusion controlled condition at flow rate below F, and is under a reaction controlled condition at flow rate above F. For the further analysis of the proposed method in the paper, the flow rate of 300 ml/min was selected.\nUnder the selected conditions described earlier for the performance of the proposed method, the calibration curve of CL intensity versus ethanol vapor concentration was linear in the range of 6\u20133750 ppm with a detection limit (3\u03c3) of 2.1 ppm, as shown in Fig. 9 . The line regression equation is described by lg I=1.07\u00d7lg C+1.37 (r=0.998, n=8, \u2018r\u2019 is the relative coefficient, and \u2018n\u2019 represents that eight ethanol concentrations were tested in the experiment), where I is the CL intensity and C is the concentration of ethanol vapor. Relative standard deviations (RSD, n=8) were 3.08%, 2.82% and 1.30% for 30, 300 and 3000 ppm ethanol vapor, respectively.\nForeign substances, such as gasoline, ammonia, hydrocarbons (cigarette smoke) and hydrogen, sometimes would unfortunately interfere with the alcohol measurements. For example, some semiconductor oxide sensors based on the change in electrical resistance of substrate materials are sensitive to ethanol, but they are also sensitive to some other gases . In order to obtain high selectivity for sensing gaseous substances, gas microchromatography has been attempted by applying micromachining technologies . This method has some disadvantages, however, such as low response and structural complication. Fig. 10 presents the selectivity of the SrCO3 sensor based on CL to a number of gases with the same concentration of 1000 ppm. It can be seen that the sensor exhibits a significantly high selectivity to ethanol. Under the optimized conditions, it is very interesting to note that there was no response of the sensor while gasoline, ammonia or hydrogen passing over the CL detection system. There are three possibilities: firstly, no reaction happens between sample gases with SrCO3; secondly, no CL was produced although sample gases can react with SrCO3; and thirdly, emitted CL signal is too weak to be detected under the optimized conditions mentioned before. To n-hexane, the interfering would not be obvious since its lower sensitivity than ethanol.\nIn order to check the stability and durability of this sensor, one experiment was carried out by continuously introducing 2000 ppm ethanol vapor to the sensor at 380 \u00b0C with the flow rate of 300 ml/min. The CL intensity was measured at the bandpass of 425 nm. The result shows that, after 100 h reaction, no obvious change can be found. The RSD (n=17) during the 100 h reaction is about 1.02%, which means that the sensor keeps the same response to ethanol vapor. As shown in Fig. 11 , the lifetime of TiO2 as the sensing material has also been studied in our previous work . It can be seen that, after 60 h reaction, the CL intensity decayed to about one-half of its original brightness. The Raman spectra showed that the carbon originated from the ethanol oxidation decreased the catalytic activity by depositing on the surface of TiO2, but can be removed in air by controlling the temperature at 500 \u00b0C for 3 h. As compared with the TiO2, the present SrCO3 sensor shows better stability and durability.\nFor the study of CL mechanism of the SrCO3 sensor, GC experiments were carried out to detect the intermediates of the catalytic oxidation of ethanol. As in the case of ethanol vapor, it is well known that there are two oxidation states of ethanol. C2H5OH+12O2\u2192CH3CHO+H2O C2H5OH\u2192C2H4+H2O The first reaction shown in Eq. (3) is a process initiating the oxidation by the dehydrogenation to CH3CHO intermediate and the second reaction in Eq. (4) is initiated by the dehydration to C2H4. The intermediates products, acetaldehyde and ethylene will then be subsequently converted to carbon dioxide and water. The GC chromatogram (shown in Fig. 12A ) for the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 at 350 \u00b0C approves the given statement. It can be seen that there are three peaks corresponding to C2H4, CH3CHO and C2H5OH, respectively, which can be identified by comparison of the retention time of the standard gases in GC. Fig. 12B shows that with the temperature increasing, the content of the products from the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 changed. The peak height of GC chromatogram corresponds to the content of this compound in the products. It can be seen that ethanol was mostly converted into ethylene in the high temperature regions, and mostly transformed to acetaldehyde in the low temperature regions. It also shows that with the conversion of ethanol improved in high temperature, the CL intensity also increased. This result can be used to explain the phenomenon that the CL intensity increased with the increasing temperature as shown in Fig. 7.\nIn order to test the real CL procedure, C2H4 and CH3CHO were directly introduced into the sensor to see if the same emission is produced. CL was observed while C2H4 or CH3CHO passing through the SrCO3 sensor. Fig. 13 shows temperature dependence of the relative CL intensity measured at 425 nm from the oxidation of CH3CHO and C2H4 on SrCO3, and the conversion of them after passing through the SrCO3 sensor, respectively. It can be seen that the CL intensity and conversion of this two gases increases with the temperature increasing, which is same with that of ethanol. This is to say, the CL phenomenon from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 can be attributed to the oxidation processes of the two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation, as shown in the following Scheme 1 .Different from the report by Nakagawa and coworkers , another way resulted in CL was found besides the oxidation of C2H4 shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). For comparison, the CL spectra of C2H5OH, CH3CHO and C2H4 on SrCO3 at 400 \u00b0C were measured, respectively. Fig. 14 shows that in the short wavelength region, the CL spectra of the three gases are similar to each other, and the CL from C2H5OH in long wavelength region shall owe to that from CH3CHO. This is to say, the CL emission processes of ethylene and acetaldehyde oxidized on SrCO3 are different. However, the electronically excited intermediate is still unknown according to the results. In fact, electronically excited formaldehyde, (HCHO)\u2217, has been confirmed as a chemiluminescing species common to all the ozone\u2013olefin reactions in terms of the gas-phase Criegie mechanism . Furthermore, HCHO as the major intermediate from the oxidation of ethylene by O3 was observed at reaction times of \u223c130 ms by utilizing photoionizaiton mass spectrometer . However, no peak of HCHO appeared after C2H4 passing through the SrCO3 sensor in our experiment. Also, the intermediate product of HCHO was not mentioned during the course of ethanol oxidation on \u03b3-Al2O3 in the literatures . According to the GC analysis, we found that HCHO as the intermediate originated from ethanol can easily be oxidized to CO2 by SrCO3. Accordingly, the existing lifetime of HCHO is so short that it cannot be transferred into the GC instrument. To CH3CHO oxidation, no other peak was observed in GC chromatogram except the peak of acetaldehyde. The CL phenomenon observed during the oxidation of acetaldehyde by O3 has also been reported, which was attributed to vibrationally excited OH . But the CL spectrum measured from 500 to 1100 nm in the literature is different from that measured from 400 to 560 nm at 400 \u00b0C in the study. Further work is required to identify the radical intermediates and explain the formation of them.\nA novel alcohol sensor based on nanosized SrCO3 in this article was firstly developed according to the generated CL from catalytic oxidation of ethanol. The simple sensor presents rapid response to ethanol vapor and is easy to operate. Wide linear response, high sensitivity, and satisfied stability show promise of this sensor for ethanol determination. This sensor also showed high selectivity to ethanol, and no interference was observed by gasoline, ammonia and hydrogen. No consumption of sensor substrate signifies the long lifetime of the gas sensor. The excellent performance surely makes the SrCO3 sensor 1 suitable for any situation where there is need for ethanol detection in areas such as breath checker and industry monitor. Also, the work is potential for the development of nanosensor based on a couple of nanoparticles, which would make the miniaturize equipment utilizing CL possible.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Nanosized materials have attracted widespread attention for their special features different from bulk materials since 1990s. Because of their high activity, good selectivity and small size, chemical sensors based on nanosized materials have been developed rapidly. For example, the individual semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT)-based chemical sensors capable of detecting small concentrations of gas molecules have been realized . Boron-doped silicon nanowire nanosensors have showed highly sensitive and selective detection of biological and chemical species . Palladium mesowire arrays for detection of hydrogen has been described based upon resistivity changes caused by the changes in the structure of the wire itself .\nSensing gas molecules is critical to industry monitoring, control of chemical processes, medical applications, environmental processes, and so on. The detection and quantification of ethanol, for instance, with high sensitivity and selectivity are required in many different fields. One of the important applications is to aid police in apprehending drink-driving offenders as a breath analyzer. Blood ethanol concentration can also be determined from its concentration in breath, a blood/breath alcohol partition ratio of 2000 having been widely adopted . In certain industry areas, such as fermentation and distillation, the ethanol vapor concentration can reach toxic levels, causing inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane and conjunctiva, irritation of the skin. The maximum permitted concentration of ethanol vapor in the work place as defined by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is 1000 ppm.\nAn efficient way is therefore required for measuring gaseous substances, including ethanol vapor, with high sensitivity and selectivity. The alcohol sensors based on nanosized materials have been studied extensively by using electrochemical methods. Sensor materials including tin oxides , rare earth oxides and other ethanol-sensing semiconducting materials have been widely investigated. However, these sensors are also sensitive to some foreign substances, such as hydrocarbon, gasoline, ammonia and hydrogen, which unfortunately interfere with the alcohol detection. In addition, more and more attention was paid to gas sensors based on the optical properties of nanosized materials. For instance, porous-silicon ethanol sensor was developed based on the shift of the Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot fringes by using laser interferometry method . Quantitative detection utilizing the quenching of photoluminescence of porous-silicon by NOx, SO2 and organic compounds has been developed . Chemiluminescence (CL) generated on the surface of nanosized materials was firstly observed during the mixture of porous-silicon and nitric acid , but no further analytical application based on the phenomenon has been developed. In recent years, Nakagawa and coworkers observed CL phenomena during the catalytic oxidation of organic vapors on the bulk materials of \u03b3-aluminum oxide (\u03b3-Al2O3) and \u03b3-Al2O3 activated by Dy3+ . However, their research work utilizing this kind of luminescence was limited to the two bulk solids. Strong CL observed from organic gases oxidized on six nanosized materials was firstly reported in our previous work . The details regarding analytical characteristics of the sensors were not involved in the paper since it is the very preliminary work. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the potentials of this new type of sensor based on nanosized SrCO3 material for the detection of ethanol by means of sensitivity, selectivity and lifetime as evaluation parameters. Nanosized SrCO3 was selected because this material showed excellent analytical characteristics over other five materials.\nThe possible mechanism of CL from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 has been studied in the paper by using gas chromatography (GC). As we know, the mechanism of gas-phase CL from the oxidation of some organic and inorganic gases by O3 has been studied intensively, such as NO+O3, SO+O3, unsaturated hydrocarbons + O3, etc. , which has been reviewed in a book . However, the CL mechanism about gases oxidized on solid catalysts was little studied except for several reports . Only one mechanism mode of CL from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on bulk material of \u03b3-Al2O3 was proposed, which attributed CL species to formaldehyde produced by the oxidation of ethylene that originated from ethanol . The following Eqs. (1) and (2) show the course of ethanol oxidation on \u03b3-Al2O3 resulted in the same CL phenomenon that has been observed during the oxidation of ethylene by O3 : C2H5OH\u2192C2H4+H2O 3C2H4+3O2\u21926HCHO+h\u03bd In this paper, however, CL can be found not only during the course of ethylene oxidation, but also from the oxidation of acetaldehyde that is another intermediate of the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3. According to the different CL phenomena not observed before and the results from GC experiments, the possible mechanism about the reaction of ethanol oxidation resulted in CL is discussed.\nThe CL detection system consists of a SrCO3 sensor and a commercial optical detector. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the SrCO3 sensor. It can be seen that a cylindrical ceramic heater of 5 mm diameter was put in a quartz tube of 12 mm inner diameter. This ceramic heater was operated at required temperature by using an electric wire inserted into the ceramic tube. Outside of the ceramic tube, a 0.5 mm layer of SrCO3 powder was sintered on the surface. The sample gas can flow only through the outside of ceramic heater because this ceramic tube is solid. The main reaction between sensor substrate and sample molecules occurred on the surface of nanosized SrCO3 powder. The CL intensity at a certain wavelength was measured with a BPCL Ultra Weak Chemiluminescence Analyzer (made by Biophysics Institute of Chinese Academy of Science in China) through variable optical filters. The SrCO3 sensor was heated at 500 \u00b0C for 30 min in air to avoid the influence of previous absorbates at the beginning of each series of experiments.\nA simple chemical precipitation method for the synthesis of nanosized SrCO3 was developed as follows: 0.1 M SrCl2 solution and 0.1 M Na2CO3 solution were firstly cooled to 2 \u00b0C. Then the Na2CO3 solution was rapidly added into the stirring SrCl2 solution at the ratios of 1:1. Immediately, the precipitation was filtered and washed with di-ionized water for five times. All of the chemicals used in the experiment were of analytical grade.\nThe topography and particle size of SrCO3 were measured using a Hitachi H-800 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The accelerating voltage of electron beam was 200 kV. Fig. 2 shows that the grain size of SrCO3 is about 60\u201370 nm. X-ray power diffraction (XRD) experiment was carried out in Rigaku DMAX-2400 diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation. From Fig. 3 , we can find that these peaks are attributed to the pure strontianite-type crystal according to the XRD standard spectrum of SrCO3 crystal. The average crystal sizes can be determined from the XRD pattern parameters according to the Scherrer equation: D C=K \u03bb/\u03b2 cos \u03b8, where D C is the average crystal size, K is the Scherrer constant equal to 0.89, \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength equal to 0.1542 nm, \u03b2 is the full width at half-maximum and \u03b8 is the diffraction angle. The average size of SrCO3 crystal synthesized in this article is about 25 nm.\nIn order to investigate the catalytic reaction processes that involve CL emission, GC experiments were carried out to identify the intermediates from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3. The SP-502 GC instrument with a flame ionization detector (FID detector, made in Lunan Chemical Engineering & Instrument Company of P.R.C., equipped with a GDX403 column, size 1.5 m\u00d74 mm) was directly coupled to the CL detection system mentioned earlier for the rapid determination of intermediates from the ethanol oxidation. Products were identified by comparison of their retention time to that of the standard compounds from Huayuan Gas Cooperation in Beijing. The conditions for GC experiments were as follows: temperature of spray chamber operated at 120 \u00b0C, column temperature operated at 100 \u00b0C, pressure of carrier gas of Ar kept at 0.38 MPa.\nThe CL response profile of ethanol was studied by the injection of ethanol vapor with different concentrations into the carrier gas with a flow rate of 150 ml/min. Fig. 4 shows the CL response profiles of 70 ml ethanol vapor on the surface of nanosized SrCO3 at 380 \u00b0C with a bandpass filter of 425 nm. Curves 1\u20133 denote the results for different concentrations of 750, 1500 and 2250 ppm, respectively. The CL signal increased sharply by about three orders of magnitude after ethanol vapor was introduced. There is a systematic increase of CL intensity with the increasing ethanol concentration. Fig. 4 also shows that the peaks of each curve appear at 7 s after sample injection, which means rapid response of this sensor to ethanol, and the profiles are similar to each other. The half decay time of CL intensity of each curve is about 30 s. The decay is related to the luminescent product and the dead volume of the used instrument.\nFig. 5 shows the CL spectra emitted from the SrCO3 sensor during the process of catalytic oxidation of ethanol vapor at the flow rate of 150 ml/min. The temperature corresponding to curves 1\u20133 is 400, 380 and 350 \u00b0C, respectively. It can be seen that the profile of each curves in the figure are similar and each curves have the same peak at around 425, 460 and 530 nm, which means the same luminescent species was produced at different temperatures. But with the increasing of sensor temperature, the CL peak at 530 nm becomes higher than other two. This is to say, CL peak positions are independent of the tested temperatures that will affect the relative CL intensity.\nAs shown in Fig. 6 , the relative S/N (signal to background noise) ratios versus wavelength at three different temperatures are established. The profiles of curves 1\u20133 are similar to each other. It shows that there are also three peaks at the same positions with Fig. 5. The position of the highest peak is at 425 nm independent of temperature, which is different from Fig. 5. In fact, the background and noise signal at longer wavelength are much higher than those at short wavelength because of the incandescence of ceramic heater at high temperature. Although the CL signal is much higher at 530 nm than other wavelengths at 400 \u00b0C as shown in Fig. 5, the S/N value at 530 nm is still lower than that at 425 and 460 nm. From Fig. 6, the profiles of S/N ratios to wavelength are little affected by the tested temperatures. So, the wavelength of 425 nm is chosen for the further study of analytical characteristics.\nTemperature dependence of the CL intensity of 500 ppm ethanol was measured under the bandpass of 425 nm and at the flow rate of 150 ml/min. Fig. 7 denotes that the CL signal increases with the increase in temperature from 350 to 470 \u00b0C. It can be attributed to the higher conversion of ethanol on SrCO3 in high temperature, which will be explained later in the paper. However, according to the values of S/N versus temperature, the maximum value of S/N could be obtained when the sensor temperature is 380 \u00b0C; under or above the temperature causes decrease in the value of S/N. The reason is probably that the noise signal also increases with the temperature increasing, and even increases faster than the CL intensity at higher temperature. Therefore, the temperature of 380 \u00b0C was selected for the further work in the paper.\nThe flow rate dependence of the CL intensity at 425 nm was measured at 380 \u00b0C from 50 to 350 ml/min as illustrated in Fig. 8 . The CL intensity of 500 ppm ethanol increases with an increase in the flow rate, and it saturates above a certain flow rate F (280 ml/min). This directly shows that the catalytic oxidation process that produces the luminescent intermediates is under a diffusion controlled condition at flow rate below F, and is under a reaction controlled condition at flow rate above F. For the further analysis of the proposed method in the paper, the flow rate of 300 ml/min was selected.\nUnder the selected conditions described earlier for the performance of the proposed method, the calibration curve of CL intensity versus ethanol vapor concentration was linear in the range of 6\u20133750 ppm with a detection limit (3\u03c3) of 2.1 ppm, as shown in Fig. 9 . The line regression equation is described by lg I=1.07\u00d7lg C+1.37 (r=0.998, n=8, \u2018r\u2019 is the relative coefficient, and \u2018n\u2019 represents that eight ethanol concentrations were tested in the experiment), where I is the CL intensity and C is the concentration of ethanol vapor. Relative standard deviations (RSD, n=8) were 3.08%, 2.82% and 1.30% for 30, 300 and 3000 ppm ethanol vapor, respectively.\nForeign substances, such as gasoline, ammonia, hydrocarbons (cigarette smoke) and hydrogen, sometimes would unfortunately interfere with the alcohol measurements. For example, some semiconductor oxide sensors based on the change in electrical resistance of substrate materials are sensitive to ethanol, but they are also sensitive to some other gases . In order to obtain high selectivity for sensing gaseous substances, gas microchromatography has been attempted by applying micromachining technologies . This method has some disadvantages, however, such as low response and structural complication. Fig. 10 presents the selectivity of the SrCO3 sensor based on CL to a number of gases with the same concentration of 1000 ppm. It can be seen that the sensor exhibits a significantly high selectivity to ethanol. Under the optimized conditions, it is very interesting to note that there was no response of the sensor while gasoline, ammonia or hydrogen passing over the CL detection system. There are three possibilities: firstly, no reaction happens between sample gases with SrCO3; secondly, no CL was produced although sample gases can react with SrCO3; and thirdly, emitted CL signal is too weak to be detected under the optimized conditions mentioned before. To n-hexane, the interfering would not be obvious since its lower sensitivity than ethanol.\nIn order to check the stability and durability of this sensor, one experiment was carried out by continuously introducing 2000 ppm ethanol vapor to the sensor at 380 \u00b0C with the flow rate of 300 ml/min. The CL intensity was measured at the bandpass of 425 nm. The result shows that, after 100 h reaction, no obvious change can be found. The RSD (n=17) during the 100 h reaction is about 1.02%, which means that the sensor keeps the same response to ethanol vapor. As shown in Fig. 11 , the lifetime of TiO2 as the sensing material has also been studied in our previous work . It can be seen that, after 60 h reaction, the CL intensity decayed to about one-half of its original brightness. The Raman spectra showed that the carbon originated from the ethanol oxidation decreased the catalytic activity by depositing on the surface of TiO2, but can be removed in air by controlling the temperature at 500 \u00b0C for 3 h. As compared with the TiO2, the present SrCO3 sensor shows better stability and durability.\nFor the study of CL mechanism of the SrCO3 sensor, GC experiments were carried out to detect the intermediates of the catalytic oxidation of ethanol. As in the case of ethanol vapor, it is well known that there are two oxidation states of ethanol. C2H5OH+12O2\u2192CH3CHO+H2O C2H5OH\u2192C2H4+H2O The first reaction shown in Eq. (3) is a process initiating the oxidation by the dehydrogenation to CH3CHO intermediate and the second reaction in Eq. (4) is initiated by the dehydration to C2H4. The intermediates products, acetaldehyde and ethylene will then be subsequently converted to carbon dioxide and water. The GC chromatogram (shown in Fig. 12A ) for the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 at 350 \u00b0C approves the given statement. It can be seen that there are three peaks corresponding to C2H4, CH3CHO and C2H5OH, respectively, which can be identified by comparison of the retention time of the standard gases in GC. Fig. 12B shows that with the temperature increasing, the content of the products from the ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 changed. The peak height of GC chromatogram corresponds to the content of this compound in the products. It can be seen that ethanol was mostly converted into ethylene in the high temperature regions, and mostly transformed to acetaldehyde in the low temperature regions. It also shows that with the conversion of ethanol improved in high temperature, the CL intensity also increased. This result can be used to explain the phenomenon that the CL intensity increased with the increasing temperature as shown in Fig. 7.\nIn order to test the real CL procedure, C2H4 and CH3CHO were directly introduced into the sensor to see if the same emission is produced. CL was observed while C2H4 or CH3CHO passing through the SrCO3 sensor. Fig. 13 shows temperature dependence of the relative CL intensity measured at 425 nm from the oxidation of CH3CHO and C2H4 on SrCO3, and the conversion of them after passing through the SrCO3 sensor, respectively. It can be seen that the CL intensity and conversion of this two gases increases with the temperature increasing, which is same with that of ethanol. This is to say, the CL phenomenon from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 can be attributed to the oxidation processes of the two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation, as shown in the following Scheme 1 .Different from the report by Nakagawa and coworkers , another way resulted in CL was found besides the oxidation of C2H4 shown in Eqs. (1) and (2). For comparison, the CL spectra of C2H5OH, CH3CHO and C2H4 on SrCO3 at 400 \u00b0C were measured, respectively. Fig. 14 shows that in the short wavelength region, the CL spectra of the three gases are similar to each other, and the CL from C2H5OH in long wavelength region shall owe to that from CH3CHO. This is to say, the CL emission processes of ethylene and acetaldehyde oxidized on SrCO3 are different. However, the electronically excited intermediate is still unknown according to the results. In fact, electronically excited formaldehyde, (HCHO)\u2217, has been confirmed as a chemiluminescing species common to all the ozone\u2013olefin reactions in terms of the gas-phase Criegie mechanism . Furthermore, HCHO as the major intermediate from the oxidation of ethylene by O3 was observed at reaction times of \u223c130 ms by utilizing photoionizaiton mass spectrometer . However, no peak of HCHO appeared after C2H4 passing through the SrCO3 sensor in our experiment. Also, the intermediate product of HCHO was not mentioned during the course of ethanol oxidation on \u03b3-Al2O3 in the literatures . According to the GC analysis, we found that HCHO as the intermediate originated from ethanol can easily be oxidized to CO2 by SrCO3. Accordingly, the existing lifetime of HCHO is so short that it cannot be transferred into the GC instrument. To CH3CHO oxidation, no other peak was observed in GC chromatogram except the peak of acetaldehyde. The CL phenomenon observed during the oxidation of acetaldehyde by O3 has also been reported, which was attributed to vibrationally excited OH . But the CL spectrum measured from 500 to 1100 nm in the literature is different from that measured from 400 to 560 nm at 400 \u00b0C in the study. Further work is required to identify the radical intermediates and explain the formation of them.\nA novel alcohol sensor based on nanosized SrCO3 in this article was firstly developed according to the generated CL from catalytic oxidation of ethanol. The simple sensor presents rapid response to ethanol vapor and is easy to operate. Wide linear response, high sensitivity, and satisfied stability show promise of this sensor for ethanol determination. This sensor also showed high selectivity to ethanol, and no interference was observed by gasoline, ammonia and hydrogen. No consumption of sensor substrate signifies the long lifetime of the gas sensor. The excellent performance surely makes the SrCO3 sensor 1 suitable for any situation where there is need for ethanol detection in areas such as breath checker and industry monitor. Also, the work is potential for the development of nanosensor based on a couple of nanoparticles, which would make the miniaturize equipment utilizing CL possible."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nPhthalate esters are widely used as additives in the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics to make them flexible. Extensive use of these chemicals resulted in their presence in various environmental matrices such as water, soil and food, including milk and other dairy products . Phthalate esters have endocrine disrupting properties . Studies have shown that phthalate esters are estrogenic and have reproductive effects in mammals . Because of the potential health impact on humans, the European Commission, for example, is proposing a ban on the use of phthalate esters in soft PVC materials for making baby toys .\nAmong all phthalate esters, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most commonly used plasticizer worldwide. DEHP is released to the environment through volatilization and leaching from plastics and other sources. Its widespread usage coupled with its persistence in the environment result in its ubiquitous presence in the environment and in biota including humans . DEHP levels in Danish retail whole milk samples were found at up to 0.14 mg kg\u22121 . A surveillance work on phthalate esters in Canadian dairy products and margarine has shown that the levels of DEHP and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) were up to 11.9 and 47.8 mg kg\u22121, respectively . Although Government of Canada does not have an permissible level of phthalates in milk or dairy products, it has recommended a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 44 \u03bcg kg (body weight)\u22121 day\u22121 for DEHP, in an assessment report in 1994 where the exposure of Canadians to DEHP from all sources was estimated at 5\u201319 \u03bcg kg (body weight)\u22121 day\u22121 depending on their age .\nSeveral analytical methods have been developed for determining phthalate esters in food samples . The most widely used approaches in sample preparation were liquid\u2013liquid solvent extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) . One of the drawbacks of using solvent in the sample preparation is that residues of phthalate esters, especially DEHP, are also found in solvents. Furthermore, fat in dairy product samples such as milk could be co-extracted and require extra steps to remove them prior to phthalate analysis by instrument analysis .\nSolid-phase microextraction (SPME) was introduced by Pawliszyn and Pawliszyn and Arthur in the early 1990s. In SPME, the extraction of target analytes from sample matrix to the fibre is conducted either directly, with the coated fibre directly immersed in the liquid sample (direct SPME), or in the headspace (HS-SPME), where the extracting fibre is suspended above the sample. Although suitable for the analysis of phthalate esters in water , sediments and sludge , the direct SPME method cannot be applied to complex matrices such as milk and other dairy products which often contain fat and other biological components.\nThe advantage of HS approach is the elimination of co-extraction of undissolved particles and non-volatile components in the sample matrix. Therefore, HS-SPME could be a potentially useful tool to selectively extract the phthalate esters, as the fibre is not directly submerged in the matrix. However, thus far, HS-SPME has only been tested in the determination of phthalate esters in water . The objectives of this study were: (1) to develop a HS-SPME based method to eliminate the fat removing procedure in the cow milk sample preparation prior to phthalate esters analysis with GC-MS (single ion monitoring, SIM) and (2) to apply this method to measure the levels of phthalate ester in milk samples collected at a dairy farm.\nA standard stock solution containing six phthalate esters, dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), in hexane at a level of 2000 ng \u03bcL\u22121 per compound was purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4 (100 ng \u03bcL\u22121) in nonane, used as internal standards in this study, were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA, USA). Dichloromethane (DCM) (GC Resolv Grade) was from Fisher Scientific (NJ, USA). Two secondary stock solutions (20 and 200 ng \u03bcL\u22121) and calibration standard solutions (0.1, 0.4, 1, 5 and 10 ng \u03bcL\u22121) were prepared by serial dilution in DCM using volumetric flasks. DBP-d4 and DEPH-d4 solution (20 ng \u03bcL\u22121) was prepared in the similar manner. Calibration standard solutions were spiked with DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4 at a concentration level of 1 ng \u03bcL\u22121.\nSPME fibre holder and 10 different types of SPME fibres (see Table 1 ) were obtained from Supelco. Fifteen millilitres SPME clear vials with PTFE/Silicone lined screw top cap were also from Supelco. A VWR 575 Digital Hotplate and stirrers were from VWR International Ltd. (Mississauga, Ont., Canada). Vacuum pump fluid used for the heating bath was from Inland Vacuum Industries, Inc. (Churchville, NY, USA).\nFive grams of cow milk was weighed into a 15 mL SPME vial using a pipette. A magnetic stirring bar and 2.5 g of sodium chloride were added into the vial afterwards and the vial was then closed with the vial cap. The vial was tightly closed to avoid possible leakage of gas when the vial was heated. Then the vial was placed into a preheated oil bath (90 \u00b0C) on a hot plate. The stirring speed was adjusted to make the solution well stirred. After 2 min, the SPME needle then was punched through the cap into the headspace of the vial and the fibre was pushed out from the protection needle to start the sampling in the headspace. The SPME holder should be placed at a height that could result in the tip of the inserted fibre to be suspended about 1.5 cm above the milk sample. After the sampling was finished, the fibre was retracted into the protection needle. The needle was then removed from the sampling vial and inserted into a clean vial to protect the fibre from exposing to laboratory air. The needle was then immediately inserted into the GC injection port for GC/-MS analysis.\nA Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph (GC, HP 5890 series) coupled with a mass selective detector (MS, HP 5972 series) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used for the analysis. The injection port was fitted with a SPME inlet guide (Supelco, Cat. No. 57356-U) and a pre-drilled Thermogreen LB-2 septa (Supelco, Cat. No. 23168) to secure the SPME fibre holder (Supelco, Cat. No. 57330-U). A special inlet liner for SPME used in this study was also from Supelco (Cat. No. 26375,05). The desorption of SPME fibre in the GC injection port was 10 min at 280 \u00b0C with purge gas off. After sample desorption, the fibre was further heated in the injection port for an additional 30 min at 280 \u00b0C with purge gas turned on to remove trace residues in the fibre while desorbed phthalate esters were being analyzed, before the next extraction. The fibre was then retracted into the protection needle and the needle was inserted into a clean vial, ready for the next sample extraction.\nAnalytes were separated on a 30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm i.d. \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness DB-5 gas chromatographic column (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) with the following oven temperature program: the initial temperature was set at 55 \u00b0C for 1 min, increased to 280 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C per minute and kept at 280 \u00b0C for 15 min.\nSelected ion monitoring mode was used for MS operation. Three ions (the first one being the target ion (T) and rest two the qualifying ions (Q1 and Q2)) were selected for each target compound. They were: m/z 163, 77 and 194 for DMP; m/z 149, 177 and 104 for DEP; m/z 149, 223 and 104 for DBP; m/z 149, 91 and 206 for BBP; m/z 149, 167 and 279 for DEHP; and m/z 149, 279 and 104 for DOP. One ion (m/z 153) was used for the quantification of both DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4. All peak area counts of the chromatograms were normalized against the internal standard DBP-d4 (for DMP, DEP and DBP, respectively) and DEHP-d4 (for BBP, DEHP and DOP, respectively) before data reduction. Each peak was manually checked by a qualified chemist for the identity and proper integration. However, a peak must have its retention time was within 1% and at least one of its two ion ratios (Q1/T or Q2/T) within \u00b130% of those of the associated standards to be considered positive.\nPhthalate esters are semi-volatile organic chemicals with vapour pressure ranging from 3.07 \u00d7 10\u22123 mmHg for DMP to 2.47 \u00d7 10\u22128 mmHg for DEHP (Table 1) . The low vapour pressure means that the concentration of phthalate esters in the headspace of SPME vials would be very low. On the other hand, direct SPME would not be appropriate due to the presence of fat and other biological components in the milk sample matrix. The development of the HS-SPME method was therefore focused on finding a proper extraction fibre and optimizing the extraction conditions such as extraction time and temperature.\nCommercially available SPME fibres for SPME can be divided into absorbent-type and adsorbent-type. Absorption type coating is a liquid film, which cross-linked to the silica rod, while adsorbent type fibres are solid particles with pores on the surface. The extraction of absorbent-type fibres is based on partitioning of analytes into a \u2018liquid-like\u2019 phase. In the case of adsorbent type fibres the particle surface interacts physically with the analytes . A total of 10 commercially available fibres with different coating materials and coating thickness (Table 1) were evaluated for their applicability to extract phthalate esters from milk samples. A commercial Homo-milk (3.25% fat) (spiked with 2 \u03bcg of each phthalate ester in 5 g milk) was used in the experiment. Table 1 summarizes the relative amount of phthalate esters collected on each fibre (normalized to the highest extracted amount among all phthalate esters) under the sample extraction condition of 90 \u00b0C for 60 min (see Section 3.2). Comparison of fibres for their extraction efficiency was also conducted at 50 \u00b0C. However, the overall amount of phthalate esters being collected was too low to be used for the purpose of selecting fibres, compared to the results obtained at 90 \u00b0C. For DMP and DEP, PDMS/DVB-StablFlex-65 \u03bcm and DVB/CAR/PDMS-50/30 \u03bcm fibres had the best results. However, for the rest of the phthalate esters listed in Table 1, PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre, a fused silica rod coated with a liquid film of cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane, had the best extraction efficiency. The ability of the coating phase to retain the analyte was also dependent on the coating thickness and the molecular weight of the analytes. It was observed that at the extraction temperature of 90 \u00b0C the extraction efficiency of the PDMS coated fibres for phthalate esters, except for DMP and DEP, was drastically reduced when the thickness of the coating was reduced from 100 to 30 \u03bcm and 7 \u03bcm. Such film thickness effects on extraction efficiency were however, not evident in the direct SPME of phthalate esters in water which was conducted at 25 \u00b0C . Such film thickness dependent extraction efficiency in headspace SPME in the case of higher molecular weight phthalate esters could be attributed to the retaining capacity of the film. The larger the liquid volume is, the more capacity of holding-back the phthalate esters the fibre possesses. For lower molecular weight phthalate esters, the gas\u2013liquid equilibrium dominates the extraction process and therefore the effects of film thickness are not significant.\nAlthough PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre had lower extraction efficiency for DMP and DEP. It was still selected as the extraction fibre for this study since DEHP and DBP are the two major phthalate esters detected in dairy products including milk . In addition, DEHP is the most important analyte in this study to achieve the objective of assessing potential migration of DEHP from PVC tubing into milk samples during milking.\nTo compensate for the low vapour pressures of phthalate esters, a high extraction temperature is desirable to accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase the concentration of the esters in the headspace. There are two governing equilibriums (gas phase \u2194 sample matrix and gas phase \u2194 liquid coating of the fibre) in HS-SPME. The high temperature would increase the concentration in the gas phase, however, it also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for \u201clighter\u201d esters such as DMP and DEP. Fig. 1 shows the relative extraction efficiency of the PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre in the temperature range of 40 and 100 \u00b0C. While the amount of \u201cheavier\u201d phthalate esters being collected on the fibre was proportional to the sample temperature, the extracted amount of DMP and DEP reached a maximum at around 70 \u00b0C and then decreased with further increases of sample temperature. The upper bound of the extraction temperature was also limited by the milk matrix as the proteins and other biological components could become clustered if the sample temperature was too high, thereby affecting the effectiveness of the stirring. To balance the extraction efficiency for all targets, a 90 \u00b0C sample temperature was selected.\nThe effects of extraction time on the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre were illustrated in Fig. 2 . The extraction efficiency of PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre reached a plateau within 60 min for most phthalate esters, except for BBP. This time was longer than 40 min required for the direct SPME extraction of phthalate esters in water , reflecting the time needed for the analytes to be released from milk matrix into the headspace and diffusion of analytes from headspace into the fibre.\nSodium chloride was added to saturate the milk sample (about 2.5 for 5 g of milk sample) to improve extraction efficiency of the phthalate esters, as addition of salt can result in enhanced ion strength in the sample matrix and in increased vapour pressure in the headspace . Compared to without salt, the extraction efficiency with a salt saturated milk sample was improved for all the phthalate esters as shown Fig. 3 . The largest improvement was for DBP (six times).\nAt the completion of HS-SPME extraction, the fibre was immediately analyzed by GC/MS. The GC desorption temperature was set at the upper limit (280 \u00b0C) of the fibre due to the semi-volatile nature of the phthalate esters. Various desorption times were studied to evaluate the completeness of desorbing phthalate esters from the fibre. The first four \u201clighter\u201d esters (DMP, DEP, DBP and BBP) could be desorbed with 99% completeness within 5 min. Greater than 99% desorption completeness for all phthalate esters was achieved in 10 min desorption time (99.9% for DMP, 99.8% for DEP, 99.8% for DBP, 99.7% for BBP, 99.1% for DEHP and 99.3% for DOP). The GC purge gas valve was kept closed so that the majority of desorbed analytes could enter the GC column. Once the desorption time of 10 min was reached, the GC purge valve was turned on and the fibre remained in the injection port at 280 \u00b0C for an additional 30 min. In this way, the remaining trace residues of the analytes could be cleaned with the large portion (98%) of the desorption stream bypassing the GC/column. The fibre was ready afterwards for the next SPME sample extraction.\nIt was observed that the absolute extraction efficiency (AEE) (defined as the percentage of the amount collected on the fibre compared to the amount spiked in the milk sample) was dependent on the fat content in the milk samples. To evaluate the effect of fat concentration, milk samples containing various amount of fat were spiked with 2 \u03bcg of each of the phthalate esters. The inverse relationship of AEE and fat content was best described by power law equations when the data from the milk sample containing 0% fat were excluded. The best curve fitting equations for all phthalate esters were listed in the caption of Fig. 4 . The AEE of phthalate esters in milk samples was lower than that from direct SPME in water samples , especially for samples containing high fat content. For example, the AEE was in the range of 2.9% (0% fat samples) and 0.27% (10.8% fat sample) for DEHP. Due to this low absolute extraction efficiency, it is very important to have the internal standards to correct for the extraction efficiency. In this study, DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 were chosen as internal standards.\nSince the AEEs of phthalate esters in the milk samples were dependent on the fat content in the milk, each milk sample therefore has to be considered a unique matrix. To address this matrix effect, the first step was to use the standard addition method to evaluate whether the relative response factor (RRF) was independent of the phthalate concentration in the sample of a given matrix. The RRF of the target analyte to the internal standard can be defined as follows: RRF=As\u00d7CisAis\u00d7Cs where A s is the peak area of the analyte, C is the concentration of the internal standard, A is the peak area of the internal standard and C s is the concentration of the analyte.\nThe range of standard addition was from 0.01 \u03bcg to 0.8 \u03bcg g\u22121 of milk sample. It was observed that RRF of an analyte remained the same for a given milk sample and there was little variation among samples with different fat content. An example of such RRFs is given in Table 2 , where typical RRFs of DEHP with various fat concentrations in milk samples are summarized. The RRFs of DEHP were constant over the concentration range for each of the sample matrices as evident by the small standard deviation (S.D.) in each sample matrix. Furthermore, the fat content ranged from 2 to 10.8 % has little effects on the RRFs, which was at 1.00 \u00b1 0.05.\nSince the RRF remained constant in a given matrix, it is possible to use one-point standard addition (unspiked sample plus one spiking level) to calculate the concentration of the analyte in the sample. Thus for spiked sample, the RRF can be calculated as follows: RRF=Asp\u00d7CisspAissp\u00d7(Csp+Cs) where A sp is the peak area of the target analyte in the spiked sample, C issp the concentration of internal standard in the spiked sample, which is equal to C is in the unspiked sample, A issp the peak area of the internal standard in the spiked sample and (C sp + C s) is the sum of the spiking level (C sp) and the concentration of the target analyte (C s).\nSince the RRF is independent of the concentration in the samples and C issp is the same as C is, Eqs. (1) and (2) can be combined to form Eq. (3) for calculating the concentration of the target analyte (C s) in the sample. Cs=As\u00d7Csp(Asp\u00d7Ais/Aissp\u2212As)\nThe detection limit (DL) was estimated using two different approaches. For analytes (DMP, DEP, BBP and DOP) that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre, the DL was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 3. For analytes (DBP and DEHP) that had detectable background levels, the DL was estimated at three times the standard deviation of the fibre blank plus the mean level in the fibre blanks (n = 27) through the study (Table 3 ). Among all phthalate esters, DEHP had the highest detection limit of 45 pg due to its high background level in the fibre. The relatively high background level of DEHP in the fibre blanks was most likely due to the ubiquitous presence of DEHP in the environment including laboratory air, as DEHP is the most widely used plasticizer present in a variety of soft plastics . The utmost care was taken to minimize the levels in the analytical system including rigorous cleaning of the fibre between samples.\nSince the AEE of phthalate esters (Fig. 4) was dependent on the fat content in the milk samples, the method detection limit (MDL) must be calculated by dividing the DL by the AEE. The best curve fitting equations for all the phthalate esters listed in Fig. 4 were used to calculate the AEE at a given fat content, except for 0% fat samples, whose direct measured values were used. For example, the MDL for DEHP varied from 0.31 ng g\u22121 in 0% fat samples to 3.3 ng g\u22121 in 10.8% fat samples. This range of MDL was lower than MDLs from solvent extraction or SPE method, which were reported to be above 10 ng g\u22121 for milk samples .\nThe accuracy for the determination of phthalate esters in milk samples was evaluated at two spiking levels of 500 and 2000 ng in 5 g of the homogenized milk, respectively, with seven replicates for each level. When subtracted by the levels in homogenized milk, the accuracy at both spiking levels was between 90 and 104%, except for DMP at the lower spiking level (82%). The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) values in this case were around 10% for both spiking levels (Table 3).\nIn the modern dairy farm, milking is done entirely by machine systems employing flexible tubing of various polymers. Concerns of potential migration of DEHP from plasticized PVC milking tubing to raw milk have been raised in the overall strategy of reducing human exposure to DEHP. Using the method described above, milk samples from six cows in a dairy farm were analyzed. Fig. 5 shows the typical selected ion (m/z 149) chromatograms of the cow milk samples, the top one is a teat sample and the bottom one is the line sample of the same cow. DMP was monitored by the target ion of m/z 163. Since no DMP was detected in any of the samples, the ion of 163 was not shown in Fig. 5. For each cow, the milk was collected by hand milking (coded as teat sample) followed by machine milking with plasticized PVC tubing (coded as line sample). All milk samples were collected in duplicate. The duplicate results, expressed in mean value and percentage of difference between the duplicate, indicate the repeatability of the method.\nThe summary results of phthalate esters in six cow milks are summarized in Table 4 . On a per-weight basis, DEHP levels in line samples (111.67\u2013282.90 ng g\u22121), were 10\u201320 times higher than the teat samples (8.40\u201323.72 ng g\u22121), while the levels of the other two detected phthalate esters (DEP and DBP) were very similar between the two groups of samples. This clearly demonstrated the migration of DEHP from PVC tubing into the raw milk during milk collection. Analysis of the PVC tubing material, which was used for collecting the test milk samples, indicated that the tubing contained 28% by weight of DEHP. DEHP concentrations in commercial milks containing up to 3% fat were reported in the range of 50\u2013130 ng g\u22121, except for one sample (380 ng g\u22121) . The levels of DEHP in the teat samples, where the raw milk did not come in contact with PVC tubing, were about 10 times above the detection limit (Table 3).\nBesides DEHP, the method was sufficiently sensitive to detect the levels of DBP and DEP in the collected cow milks. DBP was detected in all samples with concentration levels around 4\u201310 ng g\u22121, which was at least 10 times above the detection limit listed in Table 3. Levels of DEP in cow milk were found in the range of 0.5\u20131 ng g\u22121, which were above the detection limits as well. The other remaining three phthalate esters were not detected in these milk samples.\nThe HS-SPME method described in this paper is sensitive enough to measure the levels of phthalate esters in milk samples directly collected from a dairy farm. The MDLs of this method were in general lower than those previously reported. The method also avoids the solvent-consuming cleaning procedures of the solvent extraction method, which are used to remove fat present in milk samples. A combined standard addition and internal standard approach eliminates the matrix effect primarily attributed to the fat content in milk samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported analytical method using HS-SPME technique for the measurements of phthalate esters in milk samples.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

Extensive use of these chemicals resulted in their presence in various environmental matrices such as water, soil and food, including milk and other dairy products . Phthalate esters have endocrine disrupting properties . Studies have shown that phthalate esters are estrogenic and have reproductive effects in mammals . Because of the potential health impact on humans, the European Commission, for example, is proposing a ban on the use of phthalate esters in soft PVC materials for making baby toys .\nAmong all phthalate esters, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most commonly used plasticizer worldwide. DEHP is released to the environment through volatilization and leaching from plastics and other sources. Its widespread usage coupled with its persistence in the environment result in its ubiquitous presence in the environment and in biota including humans . DEHP levels in Danish retail whole milk samples were found at up to 0.14 mg kg\u22121 . A surveillance work on phthalate esters in Canadian dairy products and margarine has shown that the levels of DEHP and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) were up to 11.9 and 47.8 mg kg\u22121, respectively . Although Government of Canada does not have an permissible level of phthalates in milk or dairy products, it has recommended a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 44 \u03bcg kg (body weight)\u22121 day\u22121 for DEHP, in an assessment report in 1994 where the exposure of Canadians to DEHP from all sources was estimated at 5\u201319 \u03bcg kg (body weight)\u22121 day\u22121 depending on their age .\nSeveral analytical methods have been developed for determining phthalate esters in food samples . The most widely used approaches in sample preparation were liquid\u2013liquid solvent extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) . One of the drawbacks of using solvent in the sample preparation is that residues of phthalate esters, especially DEHP, are also found in solvents. Furthermore, fat in dairy product samples such as milk could be co-extracted and require extra steps to remove them prior to phthalate analysis by instrument analysis .\nSolid-phase microextraction (SPME) was introduced by Pawliszyn and Pawliszyn and Arthur in the early 1990s. In SPME, the extraction of target analytes from sample matrix to the fibre is conducted either directly, with the coated fibre directly immersed in the liquid sample (direct SPME), or in the headspace (HS-SPME), where the extracting fibre is suspended above the sample. Although suitable for the analysis of phthalate esters in water , sediments and sludge , the direct SPME method cannot be applied to complex matrices such as milk and other dairy products which often contain fat and other biological components.\nThe advantage of HS approach is the elimination of co-extraction of undissolved particles and non-volatile components in the sample matrix. Therefore, HS-SPME could be a potentially useful tool to selectively extract the phthalate esters, as the fibre is not directly submerged in the matrix. However, thus far, HS-SPME has only been tested in the determination of phthalate esters in water . The objectives of this study were: (1) to develop a HS-SPME based method to eliminate the fat removing procedure in the cow milk sample preparation prior to phthalate esters analysis with GC-MS (single ion monitoring, SIM) and (2) to apply this method to measure the levels of phthalate ester in milk samples collected at a dairy farm.\nA standard stock solution containing six phthalate esters, dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), in hexane at a level of 2000 ng \u03bcL\u22121 per compound was purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4 (100 ng \u03bcL\u22121) in nonane, used as internal standards in this study, were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA, USA). Dichloromethane (DCM) (GC Resolv Grade) was from Fisher Scientific (NJ, USA). Two secondary stock solutions (20 and 200 ng \u03bcL\u22121) and calibration standard solutions (0.1, 0.4, 1, 5 and 10 ng \u03bcL\u22121) were prepared by serial dilution in DCM using volumetric flasks. DBP-d4 and DEPH-d4 solution (20 ng \u03bcL\u22121) was prepared in the similar manner. Calibration standard solutions were spiked with DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4 at a concentration level of 1 ng \u03bcL\u22121.\nSPME fibre holder and 10 different types of SPME fibres (see Table 1 ) were obtained from Supelco. Fifteen millilitres SPME clear vials with PTFE/Silicone lined screw top cap were also from Supelco. A VWR 575 Digital Hotplate and stirrers were from VWR International Ltd. (Mississauga, Ont., Canada). Vacuum pump fluid used for the heating bath was from Inland Vacuum Industries, Inc. (Churchville, NY, USA).\nFive grams of cow milk was weighed into a 15 mL SPME vial using a pipette. A magnetic stirring bar and 2.5 g of sodium chloride were added into the vial afterwards and the vial was then closed with the vial cap. The vial was tightly closed to avoid possible leakage of gas when the vial was heated. Then the vial was placed into a preheated oil bath (90 \u00b0C) on a hot plate. The stirring speed was adjusted to make the solution well stirred. After 2 min, the SPME needle then was punched through the cap into the headspace of the vial and the fibre was pushed out from the protection needle to start the sampling in the headspace. The SPME holder should be placed at a height that could result in the tip of the inserted fibre to be suspended about 1.5 cm above the milk sample. After the sampling was finished, the fibre was retracted into the protection needle. The needle was then removed from the sampling vial and inserted into a clean vial to protect the fibre from exposing to laboratory air. The needle was then immediately inserted into the GC injection port for GC/-MS analysis.\nA Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph (GC, HP 5890 series) coupled with a mass selective detector (MS, HP 5972 series) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used for the analysis. The injection port was fitted with a SPME inlet guide (Supelco, Cat. No. 57356-U) and a pre-drilled Thermogreen LB-2 septa (Supelco, Cat. No. 23168) to secure the SPME fibre holder (Supelco, Cat. No. 57330-U). A special inlet liner for SPME used in this study was also from Supelco (Cat. No. 26375,05). The desorption of SPME fibre in the GC injection port was 10 min at 280 \u00b0C with purge gas off. After sample desorption, the fibre was further heated in the injection port for an additional 30 min at 280 \u00b0C with purge gas turned on to remove trace residues in the fibre while desorbed phthalate esters were being analyzed, before the next extraction. The fibre was then retracted into the protection needle and the needle was inserted into a clean vial, ready for the next sample extraction.\nAnalytes were separated on a 30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm i.d. \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness DB-5 gas chromatographic column (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) with the following oven temperature program: the initial temperature was set at 55 \u00b0C for 1 min, increased to 280 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C per minute and kept at 280 \u00b0C for 15 min.\nSelected ion monitoring mode was used for MS operation. Three ions (the first one being the target ion (T) and rest two the qualifying ions (Q1 and Q2)) were selected for each target compound. They were: m/z 163, 77 and 194 for DMP; m/z 149, 177 and 104 for DEP; m/z 149, 223 and 104 for DBP; m/z 149, 91 and 206 for BBP; m/z 149, 167 and 279 for DEHP; and m/z 149, 279 and 104 for DOP. One ion (m/z 153) was used for the quantification of both DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4. All peak area counts of the chromatograms were normalized against the internal standard DBP-d4 (for DMP, DEP and DBP, respectively) and DEHP-d4 (for BBP, DEHP and DOP, respectively) before data reduction. Each peak was manually checked by a qualified chemist for the identity and proper integration. However, a peak must have its retention time was within 1% and at least one of its two ion ratios (Q1/T or Q2/T) within \u00b130% of those of the associated standards to be considered positive.\nPhthalate esters are semi-volatile organic chemicals with vapour pressure ranging from 3.07 \u00d7 10\u22123 mmHg for DMP to 2.47 \u00d7 10\u22128 mmHg for DEHP (Table 1) . The low vapour pressure means that the concentration of phthalate esters in the headspace of SPME vials would be very low. On the other hand, direct SPME would not be appropriate due to the presence of fat and other biological components in the milk sample matrix. The development of the HS-SPME method was therefore focused on finding a proper extraction fibre and optimizing the extraction conditions such as extraction time and temperature.\nCommercially available SPME fibres for SPME can be divided into absorbent-type and adsorbent-type. Absorption type coating is a liquid film, which cross-linked to the silica rod, while adsorbent type fibres are solid particles with pores on the surface. The extraction of absorbent-type fibres is based on partitioning of analytes into a \u2018liquid-like\u2019 phase. In the case of adsorbent type fibres the particle surface interacts physically with the analytes . A total of 10 commercially available fibres with different coating materials and coating thickness (Table 1) were evaluated for their applicability to extract phthalate esters from milk samples. A commercial Homo-milk (3.25% fat) (spiked with 2 \u03bcg of each phthalate ester in 5 g milk) was used in the experiment. Table 1 summarizes the relative amount of phthalate esters collected on each fibre (normalized to the highest extracted amount among all phthalate esters) under the sample extraction condition of 90 \u00b0C for 60 min (see Section 3.2). Comparison of fibres for their extraction efficiency was also conducted at 50 \u00b0C. However, the overall amount of phthalate esters being collected was too low to be used for the purpose of selecting fibres, compared to the results obtained at 90 \u00b0C. For DMP and DEP, PDMS/DVB-StablFlex-65 \u03bcm and DVB/CAR/PDMS-50/30 \u03bcm fibres had the best results. However, for the rest of the phthalate esters listed in Table 1, PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre, a fused silica rod coated with a liquid film of cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane, had the best extraction efficiency. The ability of the coating phase to retain the analyte was also dependent on the coating thickness and the molecular weight of the analytes. It was observed that at the extraction temperature of 90 \u00b0C the extraction efficiency of the PDMS coated fibres for phthalate esters, except for DMP and DEP, was drastically reduced when the thickness of the coating was reduced from 100 to 30 \u03bcm and 7 \u03bcm. Such film thickness effects on extraction efficiency were however, not evident in the direct SPME of phthalate esters in water which was conducted at 25 \u00b0C . Such film thickness dependent extraction efficiency in headspace SPME in the case of higher molecular weight phthalate esters could be attributed to the retaining capacity of the film. The larger the liquid volume is, the more capacity of holding-back the phthalate esters the fibre possesses. For lower molecular weight phthalate esters, the gas\u2013liquid equilibrium dominates the extraction process and therefore the effects of film thickness are not significant.\nAlthough PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre had lower extraction efficiency for DMP and DEP. It was still selected as the extraction fibre for this study since DEHP and DBP are the two major phthalate esters detected in dairy products including milk . In addition, DEHP is the most important analyte in this study to achieve the objective of assessing potential migration of DEHP from PVC tubing into milk samples during milking.\nTo compensate for the low vapour pressures of phthalate esters, a high extraction temperature is desirable to accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase the concentration of the esters in the headspace. There are two governing equilibriums (gas phase \u2194 sample matrix and gas phase \u2194 liquid coating of the fibre) in HS-SPME. The high temperature would increase the concentration in the gas phase, however, it also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for \u201clighter\u201d esters such as DMP and DEP. Fig. 1 shows the relative extraction efficiency of the PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre in the temperature range of 40 and 100 \u00b0C. While the amount of \u201cheavier\u201d phthalate esters being collected on the fibre was proportional to the sample temperature, the extracted amount of DMP and DEP reached a maximum at around 70 \u00b0C and then decreased with further increases of sample temperature. The upper bound of the extraction temperature was also limited by the milk matrix as the proteins and other biological components could become clustered if the sample temperature was too high, thereby affecting the effectiveness of the stirring. To balance the extraction efficiency for all targets, a 90 \u00b0C sample temperature was selected.\nThe effects of extraction time on the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre were illustrated in Fig. 2 . The extraction efficiency of PDMS-100 \u03bcm fibre reached a plateau within 60 min for most phthalate esters, except for BBP. This time was longer than 40 min required for the direct SPME extraction of phthalate esters in water , reflecting the time needed for the analytes to be released from milk matrix into the headspace and diffusion of analytes from headspace into the fibre.\nSodium chloride was added to saturate the milk sample (about 2.5 for 5 g of milk sample) to improve extraction efficiency of the phthalate esters, as addition of salt can result in enhanced ion strength in the sample matrix and in increased vapour pressure in the headspace . Compared to without salt, the extraction efficiency with a salt saturated milk sample was improved for all the phthalate esters as shown Fig. 3 . The largest improvement was for DBP (six times).\nAt the completion of HS-SPME extraction, the fibre was immediately analyzed by GC/MS. The GC desorption temperature was set at the upper limit (280 \u00b0C) of the fibre due to the semi-volatile nature of the phthalate esters. Various desorption times were studied to evaluate the completeness of desorbing phthalate esters from the fibre. The first four \u201clighter\u201d esters (DMP, DEP, DBP and BBP) could be desorbed with 99% completeness within 5 min. Greater than 99% desorption completeness for all phthalate esters was achieved in 10 min desorption time (99.9% for DMP, 99.8% for DEP, 99.8% for DBP, 99.7% for BBP, 99.1% for DEHP and 99.3% for DOP). The GC purge gas valve was kept closed so that the majority of desorbed analytes could enter the GC column. Once the desorption time of 10 min was reached, the GC purge valve was turned on and the fibre remained in the injection port at 280 \u00b0C for an additional 30 min. In this way, the remaining trace residues of the analytes could be cleaned with the large portion (98%) of the desorption stream bypassing the GC/column. The fibre was ready afterwards for the next SPME sample extraction.\nIt was observed that the absolute extraction efficiency (AEE) (defined as the percentage of the amount collected on the fibre compared to the amount spiked in the milk sample) was dependent on the fat content in the milk samples. To evaluate the effect of fat concentration, milk samples containing various amount of fat were spiked with 2 \u03bcg of each of the phthalate esters. The inverse relationship of AEE and fat content was best described by power law equations when the data from the milk sample containing 0% fat were excluded. The best curve fitting equations for all phthalate esters were listed in the caption of Fig. 4 . The AEE of phthalate esters in milk samples was lower than that from direct SPME in water samples , especially for samples containing high fat content. For example, the AEE was in the range of 2.9% (0% fat samples) and 0.27% (10.8% fat sample) for DEHP. Due to this low absolute extraction efficiency, it is very important to have the internal standards to correct for the extraction efficiency. In this study, DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 were chosen as internal standards.\nSince the AEEs of phthalate esters in the milk samples were dependent on the fat content in the milk, each milk sample therefore has to be considered a unique matrix. To address this matrix effect, the first step was to use the standard addition method to evaluate whether the relative response factor (RRF) was independent of the phthalate concentration in the sample of a given matrix. The RRF of the target analyte to the internal standard can be defined as follows: RRF=As\u00d7CisAis\u00d7Cs where A s is the peak area of the analyte, C is the concentration of the internal standard, A is the peak area of the internal standard and C s is the concentration of the analyte.\nThe range of standard addition was from 0.01 \u03bcg to 0.8 \u03bcg g\u22121 of milk sample. It was observed that RRF of an analyte remained the same for a given milk sample and there was little variation among samples with different fat content. An example of such RRFs is given in Table 2 , where typical RRFs of DEHP with various fat concentrations in milk samples are summarized. The RRFs of DEHP were constant over the concentration range for each of the sample matrices as evident by the small standard deviation (S.D.) in each sample matrix. Furthermore, the fat content ranged from 2 to 10.8 % has little effects on the RRFs, which was at 1.00 \u00b1 0.05.\nSince the RRF remained constant in a given matrix, it is possible to use one-point standard addition (unspiked sample plus one spiking level) to calculate the concentration of the analyte in the sample. Thus for spiked sample, the RRF can be calculated as follows: RRF=Asp\u00d7CisspAissp\u00d7(Csp+Cs) where A sp is the peak area of the target analyte in the spiked sample, C issp the concentration of internal standard in the spiked sample, which is equal to C is in the unspiked sample, A issp the peak area of the internal standard in the spiked sample and (C sp + C s) is the sum of the spiking level (C sp) and the concentration of the target analyte (C s).\nSince the RRF is independent of the concentration in the samples and C issp is the same as C is, Eqs. (1) and (2) can be combined to form Eq. (3) for calculating the concentration of the target analyte (C s) in the sample. Cs=As\u00d7Csp(Asp\u00d7Ais/Aissp\u2212As)\nThe detection limit (DL) was estimated using two different approaches. For analytes (DMP, DEP, BBP and DOP) that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre, the DL was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 3. For analytes (DBP and DEHP) that had detectable background levels, the DL was estimated at three times the standard deviation of the fibre blank plus the mean level in the fibre blanks (n = 27) through the study (Table 3 ). Among all phthalate esters, DEHP had the highest detection limit of 45 pg due to its high background level in the fibre. The relatively high background level of DEHP in the fibre blanks was most likely due to the ubiquitous presence of DEHP in the environment including laboratory air, as DEHP is the most widely used plasticizer present in a variety of soft plastics . The utmost care was taken to minimize the levels in the analytical system including rigorous cleaning of the fibre between samples.\nSince the AEE of phthalate esters (Fig. 4) was dependent on the fat content in the milk samples, the method detection limit (MDL) must be calculated by dividing the DL by the AEE. The best curve fitting equations for all the phthalate esters listed in Fig. 4 were used to calculate the AEE at a given fat content, except for 0% fat samples, whose direct measured values were used. For example, the MDL for DEHP varied from 0.31 ng g\u22121 in 0% fat samples to 3.3 ng g\u22121 in 10.8% fat samples. This range of MDL was lower than MDLs from solvent extraction or SPE method, which were reported to be above 10 ng g\u22121 for milk samples .\nThe accuracy for the determination of phthalate esters in milk samples was evaluated at two spiking levels of 500 and 2000 ng in 5 g of the homogenized milk, respectively, with seven replicates for each level. When subtracted by the levels in homogenized milk, the accuracy at both spiking levels was between 90 and 104%, except for DMP at the lower spiking level (82%). The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) values in this case were around 10% for both spiking levels (Table 3).\nIn the modern dairy farm, milking is done entirely by machine systems employing flexible tubing of various polymers. Concerns of potential migration of DEHP from plasticized PVC milking tubing to raw milk have been raised in the overall strategy of reducing human exposure to DEHP. Using the method described above, milk samples from six cows in a dairy farm were analyzed. Fig. 5 shows the typical selected ion (m/z 149) chromatograms of the cow milk samples, the top one is a teat sample and the bottom one is the line sample of the same cow. DMP was monitored by the target ion of m/z 163. Since no DMP was detected in any of the samples, the ion of 163 was not shown in Fig. 5. For each cow, the milk was collected by hand milking (coded as teat sample) followed by machine milking with plasticized PVC tubing (coded as line sample). All milk samples were collected in duplicate. The duplicate results, expressed in mean value and percentage of difference between the duplicate, indicate the repeatability of the method.\nThe summary results of phthalate esters in six cow milks are summarized in Table 4 . On a per-weight basis, DEHP levels in line samples (111.67\u2013282.90 ng g\u22121), were 10\u201320 times higher than the teat samples (8.40\u201323.72 ng g\u22121), while the levels of the other two detected phthalate esters (DEP and DBP) were very similar between the two groups of samples. This clearly demonstrated the migration of DEHP from PVC tubing into the raw milk during milk collection. Analysis of the PVC tubing material, which was used for collecting the test milk samples, indicated that the tubing contained 28% by weight of DEHP. DEHP concentrations in commercial milks containing up to 3% fat were reported in the range of 50\u2013130 ng g\u22121, except for one sample (380 ng g\u22121) . The levels of DEHP in the teat samples, where the raw milk did not come in contact with PVC tubing, were about 10 times above the detection limit (Table 3).\nBesides DEHP, the method was sufficiently sensitive to detect the levels of DBP and DEP in the collected cow milks. DBP was detected in all samples with concentration levels around 4\u201310 ng g\u22121, which was at least 10 times above the detection limit listed in Table 3. Levels of DEP in cow milk were found in the range of 0.5\u20131 ng g\u22121, which were above the detection limits as well. The other remaining three phthalate esters were not detected in these milk samples.\nThe HS-SPME method described in this paper is sensitive enough to measure the levels of phthalate esters in milk samples directly collected from a dairy farm. The MDLs of this method were in general lower than those previously reported. The method also avoids the solvent-consuming cleaning procedures of the solvent extraction method, which are used to remove fat present in milk samples. A combined standard addition and internal standard approach eliminates the matrix effect primarily attributed to the fat content in milk samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported analytical method using HS-SPME technique for the measurements of phthalate esters in milk samples."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nOver the last few years, molecular imprinting technique has received considerable attention in the fields of polymer science and chemical analysis, owing to its predetermined selectivity for target molecular, high affinity and robustness . Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are synthesized in the presence of functional monomers, template molecules and cross-linking agent by covalent , non-covalent and sacrificial spacer methods . Binding sites with molecular recognition properties are formed after template molecules are removed from the polymerized material, leaving behind cavities complementary in size and shape to the template for the subsequent rebinding process. MIPs have been extensively used in several applications such as solid phase extraction (SPE) , chromatographic separation , catalysis facilitation and artificial reception .\nIn recent years, MIPs have been gained wide acceptance as new molecular recognition materials in chemical sensors, since they are more stable, less costly and easier to produce as compared to their biological counterparts including antibodies and enzymes . Various chemical sensors have been prepared using MIPs for molecular recognition followed by appropriate signal transductions including capacitance , conductometry , amperometry , voltammetry , quartz microbalance and spectroscopy . Potentiometric sensors are generic and highly successful approaches to chemical sensing, and MIP based potentiometric sensors have shown to be very promising . Unlike sensors based other transduction techniques, potentiometric sensors do not require the template molecules to diffuse through the electrode membranes for generation of membrane potentials , thus dramatically reducing the response time. However, reports on MIP based potentiometric sensors are still rather rare .\nMelamine, 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine, slightly soluble in water, is a common organic compound that is often used with formaldehyde to produce melamine resin, a synthetic polymer as fire resistant and heat tolerant . Melamine became a topic of much discussion in early 2007, when veterinary scientists determined it to be the cause of hundreds of pet deaths due to pet food contamination. Especially, the 2008 melamine-tainted-milk powder incident in China led to serious concern about melamine for food safety. Consequently, several methods have been developed for melamine detection in food, such as liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry , solid phase extraction , ultraviolet spectrum, Raman spectroscopy and ion chromatography . However, these methods require expensive apparatus and complicated pretreatment. Since potentiometric technique allows sensitive, simple and inexpensive detection of analyte, it would be a promising alternative for melamine analysis in food samples. In this paper, a polymeric membrane ion-selective electrode (ISE) based on MIP is described for the determination of melamine in milk. Melamine is a weak base with a pK a of 5.05, and is readily protonated in aqueous solution at pHs lower than 5.0. The protonated melamine can thus be measured potentiometrically by the ISE. Interference from high concentrations of ions co-existing in milk such as K+ and Na+ can be effectively eliminated by on-line introduction of anion and cation-exchanger tandem columns placed upstream. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first sensing system for rapid determination of melamine.\nMelamine, methacrylic acid (MAA), benzene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were obtained from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), 2,2\u2032-azobisisobutyronitrle (AIBN), 2-nitrophenyloctyl ether (NPOE), bis(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate (DOS), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), sodium tetrakis [3,5-bis(trifluoro-methyl)phenyl]borate (NaTFPB) and high molecular weight poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 732 strong-acid cation-exchange resin and 717 strong-base anion-exchange resin were obtained from Guoyao Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) for sample separation. Aqueous solutions were prepared with freshly de-ionized water (18.2 M\u03a9 cm specific resistance) obtained with a Pall Cascada laboratory water system. A stock solution of 0.01 M melamine was made by dissolving 1.261 g of melamine in 1 L of 0.05 M acetic acid solution. MAA, EGDMA, benzene and THF were distilled in vacuum prior to use. All other reagents were analytical grade and used without any further purification.\nThe schematic representation of the non-covalent imprinting process and removal of template is shown in Fig. 1 . The MIP was prepared by the non-covalent method. Firstly, pre-complexation was obtained by mixing melamine (0.2 mmol) template and MAA (0.8 mmol) functional monomer with benzene (100 mL) in a 250 mL flask and sonicating for 10 min to maintain homogeneity. Secondly, EGDMA (2.4 mmol) and AIBN (1 mmol) were dropped into the flask as a cross-linker and an initiator, respectively, and then the resulting mixture was purged with N2 for 5 min and sonicated for 10 min. Lastly, the flask was sealed under N2 atmosphere and placed in an oil bath at 80 \u00b0C for 17 h for polymerization. The produced polymer was crushed, grounded and sieved to particle sizes ranging from 50 to 150 \u03bcm. Removal of the template and unreacted monomers was done by washing the polymer successively in methanol/acetic acid solution (8:2, v/v) for three times, each time for 3 h, and then twice in 70 \u00b0C de-ionized water for 2 h. The recycle time (\u223c6 times) for washing process was finished until no absorption of the de-ionized water at 235 nm was observed with a Beckman DU-800 UV spectrophotometer. The non-imprinted polymer (NIP) was synthesized by the similar procedure in the absence of template molecules.\nMembrane contained (in wt%) MIP or NIP (6.1), NaTFPB (1.5), NPOE (61.1), and PVC (31.3). The components of each membrane (totaling 360 mg) were dissolved in THF (3.5 mL) and poured into a glass ring (i.d. 36 mm) fixed on a glass plate. Overnight evaporation of the solvent yields membranes of \u223c200 \u03bcm. For each electrode, a disk of 9-mm diameter was punched from the membranes and glued to a plasticized PVC tubing with THF/PVC slurry. For measurement of melamine, the internal filling and conditioning medium were 10\u22124 mol L\u22121 melamine in 0.02 M acetate buffer of pH 3.7, while for measurement of experimental selectivity coefficients, 0.01 M NaCl was used as the internal filling and conditioning medium. All the electrodes were conditioned for one day before measurement.\n1.5 g of 717-type anion-exchanger resin and that of 732-type cation-exchanger resin were treated with 25 mL of 1 M NaOH and 1 M HCl, respectively, equilibrating for 12 h under constant agitation. The resulting 717 hydroxide-form anion-exchanger resin and 732 hydrogen-form cation-exchanger resin were washed with de-ionized water and then packed separately in a 10-cm length of glass column (5.0 mm i.d.) and furnished with glass wool at both ends to retain the resins. The two columns were tandem connected for sample separation.\nPrior to sample analysis, 10 mL of ethanol was added into the same amount of milk sample. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm and the supernatant was filtered through a standard 0.45 \u03bcm filter in order to remove the proteins which might interfere with the measurement probably due to its adsorption on the surface of membrane electrode, as reported by Ramamurthy et al. .\nAll measurements of emf were performed at 20\u201321 \u00b0C using a PXSJ-216L pH meter (Leici, Shanghai) with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode in the galvanic cell: SCE//sample solution/ISE membrane/inner filling solution/3 M KCl/AgCl/Ag. Melamine standards were prepared by consecutively diluting 0.01 M of melamine with 0.02 M acetate buffer of pH 3.7. Selectivity coefficients were determined by the separate solution method in metal chloride solutions. The activity coefficient of ions, \u03b3, was calculated from the modified Debye-H\u00fckel equation: log\u03b3=\u22120.511z2\u03bc1+1.5\u03bc\u22120.2\u03bc where \u03bc is the ionic strength and z is the valence of the concerned ion.\nThe apparatus manifold employed is shown in Fig. 2 . The sample stream was delivered by one peristaltic pump (IFIS-D, Xi\u2019an Remex Analyse Instrument Co., Ltd.) to flow through the ion-exchanger resin columns at a relatively low flow rate of 0.5 mL min\u22121 for efficient removal of interfering ions co-existing in milk. The de-ionized sample solution was merged at a Y-joint with 0.02 M acetate buffer solution of pH 3.7 delivered by another peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min\u22121 to produce protonated melamine, which was then measured by the MIP based ISE placed in a flow cell (200 \u03bcl). PTFE tubing (0.8 mm i.d.) was used throughout the procedure to connect all components in the flow system.\nThe influence of membrane composition on the potential response was tested and the results are shown in Table 1 . Since the plasticizer/PVC ratio of about two results in suitable performance characteristics , this ratio was kept constant in the optimization of membrane composition. It was found that the membrane with NPOE provided a better response with a wider linear response range (5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M) compared to those with DOS (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M) and DOP (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M). Since lipophilic salts or ionic additives can decrease the membrane resistance, reduce anion interference and improve selectivity of the electrode , NaTFPB was incorporated in the membrane. Experiments show that the response slope of the MIP based membrane can be improved to be nearly theoretical with the lipophilic borate. The sensitivity and linearity for the membrane electrode also depends on the amount of MIP which determines the number of the binding sites. It can be seen that the potential sensitivity increases upon increasing the amount of MIP. However, at amounts above 6.1 wt%, MIP becomes insoluble in the membrane which may cause low electrical conductivity and poor sensor response. Table 1 indicates that the membrane with 31.3 wt% of PVC, 61.1 wt% of NPOE, 1.5 wt% of borate and 6.1 wt% of MIP shows the best performance.\nDegree of cross-linking is the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer during polymerization process, which is essential for the formation of binding sites. The stable shape of complementary cavity for imprinted process cannot be maintained with low degree of cross-linking. However, high degree of cross-linking may result in difficulties in removal of template from the polymer and insolubility of MIP in the solvent . To choose a suitable degree of cross-linking for polymerization process, the effect of the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer was investigated in the range of 1\u20135. Fig. 3 shows that the variation of degree of cross-linking exhibits a significant difference in the potential response, and the mole ratio of 3 gives the best response in terms of wider linear range and lower detection limit.\nThe influence of sample pH on the potential response of MIP based melamine ISE was tested with melamine of 10\u22124 and 10\u22123 M in the pH range of 1.5\u20137.0. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the potential response is nearly constant in the pH range of 3.0\u20134.5, but potential decreases appear at pHs beyond this range. This is probably due to the fact that at pH > 4.5, melamine mainly exists as a neutral molecule which shows no potential response at ISE; but at pH < 3, melamine can be hydrolyzed and converted to other species such as ammeline and cyanuric acid , which leads to the decrease of the amount of protonated melamine ions.\nThe potential response curves of MIP- and NIP-based membranes and the blank membrane (only with borate) are shown in Fig. 5 . The MIP based membrane shows a near-Nernstian response of 54.1 mV/decade over the concentration range of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121 with a detection limit of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121. However, the NIP-based and blank membranes exhibit a near-Nernstian response in a rather narrow concentration range, which is probably due to the nonspecific interaction of the protonated melamine ion with the ion-exchanger in the polymeric membrane. Evidently, it can be demonstrated that the MIP is effective for specific recognition of the target ion.\nThe response time of the MIP based membrane ISE is defined as the average time required for the sensor to reach \u00b11 mV of the magnitude of the equilibrated potential signal after successively immersing in a series of melamine ion solutions, each having a 10-fold concentration difference . The dynamic potential response with time is shown in Fig. 6 , where the melamine concentration is changed between 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol L\u22121. It can be seen that the response of the MIP sensor is rapid (\u223c16 s) and fully reversible. Experiments also showed that no significant changes were observed in the response characteristics of the MIP-based melamine ISE after the electrode was stored in the conditioning solution for 2 months. Since ethanol is added to the sample solution for protein removal during the pretreatment procedure, the durability of the membrane electrode in ethanol solution was evaluated by measuring the response to the protonated melamine after storage in the ethanol/H2O solution (1:4, v/v) for 24 h. No loss of response was observed for the proposed electrode after this time.\nThe selectivity coefficients (KM,Xpot) for melamine (M) toward interfering ions (X) were evaluated by using the \u201cstrong interference\u201d method introduced by Bakker to eliminate the influence of the inherent sensitivity limit on the ISE response toward discriminated ions . The results of selectivity of MIP based ISE towards discriminated ions are shown in Fig. 7 . Potentiometric selectivity coefficient values for the MIP or NIP-based ISE are summarized in Table 2 . It can be seen that the proposed electrode shows high selectivity to melamine ion over other cations such as Na+, K+, H+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. The selectivity coefficients of the proposed MIP membrane electrode over interfering ions such as Na+ and K+ are superior to those of the NIP membrane electrode due to the specific recognition of the MIP for the target ion.\nMilk samples contain rather high concentrations of interfering ions such as \u223c10\u22122 mol L\u22121 of Na+, K+ and Ca2+, therefore it is necessary to employ the ion-exchanger resin columns in the flow system to eliminate the interference of anion and cation co-existing in milk samples. Since melamine exists as neutral molecules in milk samples with a pH of \u223c6.7, it could flow through the ion-exchanger column without any loss. The effect of the ion-exchanger columns for measurement of melamine in pretreated milk samples is shown in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that the flow system with the ion-exchanger columns indeed shows a wider linearity range of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121 and a lower detection limit of 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121, as compared to that without the columns which suffers from serious interference problems and has a rather poor detection limit of 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol L\u22121. Experiments also indicate that the anion-exchanger column should be placed ahead of the cation-exchanger column for the tandem sequence. Such design can avoid the formation of acid solution (pH < 3) when the sample flows through the cation-exchanger column and exchange the co-existing cations with H+ on the resins, which may cause the decomposition of melamine as discussed before. It should be noted that the response slope for measurement of protonated melamine in the pretreated milk samples (\u223c47.2 mV/decade) is a bit lower than that of the standard calibration curve (\u223c54.1 mV/decade) for measurement in buffer solution, which is probably due to the matrix effect caused by the addition of ethanol to the sample solution during the pretreatment procedure.\nThe lifetime of the ion-exchanger column was calculated by the theoretical capacities of the cation-exchanger and anion-exchanger resins (4.2 and 3.0 mequiv. g\u22121, respectively, as reported by the manufacturer). It can be estimated that the ion-exchanger column would be used for ca. 100 times.\nThe flow analysis system based on the MIP based membrane electrode was used to analyze melamine in spiked milk samples which was pretreated with protein removal. The results are given in Table 3 .

        "txt": "Over the last few years, molecular imprinting technique has received considerable attention in the fields of polymer science and chemical analysis, owing to its predetermined selectivity for target molecular, high affinity and robustness . Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are synthesized in the presence of functional monomers, template molecules and cross-linking agent by covalent , non-covalent and sacrificial spacer methods . Binding sites with molecular recognition properties are formed after template molecules are removed from the polymerized material, leaving behind cavities complementary in size and shape to the template for the subsequent rebinding process. MIPs have been extensively used in several applications such as solid phase extraction (SPE) , chromatographic separation , catalysis facilitation and artificial reception .\nIn recent years, MIPs have been gained wide acceptance as new molecular recognition materials in chemical sensors, since they are more stable, less costly and easier to produce as compared to their biological counterparts including antibodies and enzymes . Various chemical sensors have been prepared using MIPs for molecular recognition followed by appropriate signal transductions including capacitance , conductometry , amperometry , voltammetry , quartz microbalance and spectroscopy . Potentiometric sensors are generic and highly successful approaches to chemical sensing, and MIP based potentiometric sensors have shown to be very promising . Unlike sensors based other transduction techniques, potentiometric sensors do not require the template molecules to diffuse through the electrode membranes for generation of membrane potentials , thus dramatically reducing the response time. However, reports on MIP based potentiometric sensors are still rather rare .\nMelamine, 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine, slightly soluble in water, is a common organic compound that is often used with formaldehyde to produce melamine resin, a synthetic polymer as fire resistant and heat tolerant . Melamine became a topic of much discussion in early 2007, when veterinary scientists determined it to be the cause of hundreds of pet deaths due to pet food contamination. Especially, the 2008 melamine-tainted-milk powder incident in China led to serious concern about melamine for food safety. Consequently, several methods have been developed for melamine detection in food, such as liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry , solid phase extraction , ultraviolet spectrum, Raman spectroscopy and ion chromatography . However, these methods require expensive apparatus and complicated pretreatment. Since potentiometric technique allows sensitive, simple and inexpensive detection of analyte, it would be a promising alternative for melamine analysis in food samples. In this paper, a polymeric membrane ion-selective electrode (ISE) based on MIP is described for the determination of melamine in milk. Melamine is a weak base with a pK a of 5.05, and is readily protonated in aqueous solution at pHs lower than 5.0. The protonated melamine can thus be measured potentiometrically by the ISE. Interference from high concentrations of ions co-existing in milk such as K+ and Na+ can be effectively eliminated by on-line introduction of anion and cation-exchanger tandem columns placed upstream. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first sensing system for rapid determination of melamine.\nMelamine, methacrylic acid (MAA), benzene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were obtained from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), 2,2\u2032-azobisisobutyronitrle (AIBN), 2-nitrophenyloctyl ether (NPOE), bis(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate (DOS), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), sodium tetrakis [3,5-bis(trifluoro-methyl)phenyl]borate (NaTFPB) and high molecular weight poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 732 strong-acid cation-exchange resin and 717 strong-base anion-exchange resin were obtained from Guoyao Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) for sample separation. Aqueous solutions were prepared with freshly de-ionized water (18.2 M\u03a9 cm specific resistance) obtained with a Pall Cascada laboratory water system. A stock solution of 0.01 M melamine was made by dissolving 1.261 g of melamine in 1 L of 0.05 M acetic acid solution. MAA, EGDMA, benzene and THF were distilled in vacuum prior to use. All other reagents were analytical grade and used without any further purification.\nThe schematic representation of the non-covalent imprinting process and removal of template is shown in Fig. 1 . The MIP was prepared by the non-covalent method. Firstly, pre-complexation was obtained by mixing melamine (0.2 mmol) template and MAA (0.8 mmol) functional monomer with benzene (100 mL) in a 250 mL flask and sonicating for 10 min to maintain homogeneity. Secondly, EGDMA (2.4 mmol) and AIBN (1 mmol) were dropped into the flask as a cross-linker and an initiator, respectively, and then the resulting mixture was purged with N2 for 5 min and sonicated for 10 min. Lastly, the flask was sealed under N2 atmosphere and placed in an oil bath at 80 \u00b0C for 17 h for polymerization. The produced polymer was crushed, grounded and sieved to particle sizes ranging from 50 to 150 \u03bcm. Removal of the template and unreacted monomers was done by washing the polymer successively in methanol/acetic acid solution (8:2, v/v) for three times, each time for 3 h, and then twice in 70 \u00b0C de-ionized water for 2 h. The recycle time (\u223c6 times) for washing process was finished until no absorption of the de-ionized water at 235 nm was observed with a Beckman DU-800 UV spectrophotometer. The non-imprinted polymer (NIP) was synthesized by the similar procedure in the absence of template molecules.\nMembrane contained (in wt%) MIP or NIP (6.1), NaTFPB (1.5), NPOE (61.1), and PVC (31.3). The components of each membrane (totaling 360 mg) were dissolved in THF (3.5 mL) and poured into a glass ring (i.d. 36 mm) fixed on a glass plate. Overnight evaporation of the solvent yields membranes of \u223c200 \u03bcm. For each electrode, a disk of 9-mm diameter was punched from the membranes and glued to a plasticized PVC tubing with THF/PVC slurry. For measurement of melamine, the internal filling and conditioning medium were 10\u22124 mol L\u22121 melamine in 0.02 M acetate buffer of pH 3.7, while for measurement of experimental selectivity coefficients, 0.01 M NaCl was used as the internal filling and conditioning medium. All the electrodes were conditioned for one day before measurement.\n1.5 g of 717-type anion-exchanger resin and that of 732-type cation-exchanger resin were treated with 25 mL of 1 M NaOH and 1 M HCl, respectively, equilibrating for 12 h under constant agitation. The resulting 717 hydroxide-form anion-exchanger resin and 732 hydrogen-form cation-exchanger resin were washed with de-ionized water and then packed separately in a 10-cm length of glass column (5.0 mm i.d.) and furnished with glass wool at both ends to retain the resins. The two columns were tandem connected for sample separation.\nPrior to sample analysis, 10 mL of ethanol was added into the same amount of milk sample. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm and the supernatant was filtered through a standard 0.45 \u03bcm filter in order to remove the proteins which might interfere with the measurement probably due to its adsorption on the surface of membrane electrode, as reported by Ramamurthy et al. .\nAll measurements of emf were performed at 20\u201321 \u00b0C using a PXSJ-216L pH meter (Leici, Shanghai) with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode in the galvanic cell: SCE//sample solution/ISE membrane/inner filling solution/3 M KCl/AgCl/Ag. Melamine standards were prepared by consecutively diluting 0.01 M of melamine with 0.02 M acetate buffer of pH 3.7. Selectivity coefficients were determined by the separate solution method in metal chloride solutions. The activity coefficient of ions, \u03b3, was calculated from the modified Debye-H\u00fckel equation: log\u03b3=\u22120.511z2\u03bc1+1.5\u03bc\u22120.2\u03bc where \u03bc is the ionic strength and z is the valence of the concerned ion.\nThe apparatus manifold employed is shown in Fig. 2 . The sample stream was delivered by one peristaltic pump (IFIS-D, Xi\u2019an Remex Analyse Instrument Co., Ltd.) to flow through the ion-exchanger resin columns at a relatively low flow rate of 0.5 mL min\u22121 for efficient removal of interfering ions co-existing in milk. The de-ionized sample solution was merged at a Y-joint with 0.02 M acetate buffer solution of pH 3.7 delivered by another peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min\u22121 to produce protonated melamine, which was then measured by the MIP based ISE placed in a flow cell (200 \u03bcl). PTFE tubing (0.8 mm i.d.) was used throughout the procedure to connect all components in the flow system.\nThe influence of membrane composition on the potential response was tested and the results are shown in Table 1 . Since the plasticizer/PVC ratio of about two results in suitable performance characteristics , this ratio was kept constant in the optimization of membrane composition. It was found that the membrane with NPOE provided a better response with a wider linear response range (5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M) compared to those with DOS (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M) and DOP (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M). Since lipophilic salts or ionic additives can decrease the membrane resistance, reduce anion interference and improve selectivity of the electrode , NaTFPB was incorporated in the membrane. Experiments show that the response slope of the MIP based membrane can be improved to be nearly theoretical with the lipophilic borate. The sensitivity and linearity for the membrane electrode also depends on the amount of MIP which determines the number of the binding sites. It can be seen that the potential sensitivity increases upon increasing the amount of MIP. However, at amounts above 6.1 wt%, MIP becomes insoluble in the membrane which may cause low electrical conductivity and poor sensor response. Table 1 indicates that the membrane with 31.3 wt% of PVC, 61.1 wt% of NPOE, 1.5 wt% of borate and 6.1 wt% of MIP shows the best performance.\nDegree of cross-linking is the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer during polymerization process, which is essential for the formation of binding sites. The stable shape of complementary cavity for imprinted process cannot be maintained with low degree of cross-linking. However, high degree of cross-linking may result in difficulties in removal of template from the polymer and insolubility of MIP in the solvent . To choose a suitable degree of cross-linking for polymerization process, the effect of the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer was investigated in the range of 1\u20135. Fig. 3 shows that the variation of degree of cross-linking exhibits a significant difference in the potential response, and the mole ratio of 3 gives the best response in terms of wider linear range and lower detection limit.\nThe influence of sample pH on the potential response of MIP based melamine ISE was tested with melamine of 10\u22124 and 10\u22123 M in the pH range of 1.5\u20137.0. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . It can be seen that the potential response is nearly constant in the pH range of 3.0\u20134.5, but potential decreases appear at pHs beyond this range. This is probably due to the fact that at pH > 4.5, melamine mainly exists as a neutral molecule which shows no potential response at ISE; but at pH < 3, melamine can be hydrolyzed and converted to other species such as ammeline and cyanuric acid , which leads to the decrease of the amount of protonated melamine ions.\nThe potential response curves of MIP- and NIP-based membranes and the blank membrane (only with borate) are shown in Fig. 5 . The MIP based membrane shows a near-Nernstian response of 54.1 mV/decade over the concentration range of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121 with a detection limit of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121. However, the NIP-based and blank membranes exhibit a near-Nernstian response in a rather narrow concentration range, which is probably due to the nonspecific interaction of the protonated melamine ion with the ion-exchanger in the polymeric membrane. Evidently, it can be demonstrated that the MIP is effective for specific recognition of the target ion.\nThe response time of the MIP based membrane ISE is defined as the average time required for the sensor to reach \u00b11 mV of the magnitude of the equilibrated potential signal after successively immersing in a series of melamine ion solutions, each having a 10-fold concentration difference . The dynamic potential response with time is shown in Fig. 6 , where the melamine concentration is changed between 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol L\u22121. It can be seen that the response of the MIP sensor is rapid (\u223c16 s) and fully reversible. Experiments also showed that no significant changes were observed in the response characteristics of the MIP-based melamine ISE after the electrode was stored in the conditioning solution for 2 months. Since ethanol is added to the sample solution for protein removal during the pretreatment procedure, the durability of the membrane electrode in ethanol solution was evaluated by measuring the response to the protonated melamine after storage in the ethanol/H2O solution (1:4, v/v) for 24 h. No loss of response was observed for the proposed electrode after this time.\nThe selectivity coefficients (KM,Xpot) for melamine (M) toward interfering ions (X) were evaluated by using the \u201cstrong interference\u201d method introduced by Bakker to eliminate the influence of the inherent sensitivity limit on the ISE response toward discriminated ions . The results of selectivity of MIP based ISE towards discriminated ions are shown in Fig. 7 . Potentiometric selectivity coefficient values for the MIP or NIP-based ISE are summarized in Table 2 . It can be seen that the proposed electrode shows high selectivity to melamine ion over other cations such as Na+, K+, H+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. The selectivity coefficients of the proposed MIP membrane electrode over interfering ions such as Na+ and K+ are superior to those of the NIP membrane electrode due to the specific recognition of the MIP for the target ion.\nMilk samples contain rather high concentrations of interfering ions such as \u223c10\u22122 mol L\u22121 of Na+, K+ and Ca2+, therefore it is necessary to employ the ion-exchanger resin columns in the flow system to eliminate the interference of anion and cation co-existing in milk samples. Since melamine exists as neutral molecules in milk samples with a pH of \u223c6.7, it could flow through the ion-exchanger column without any loss. The effect of the ion-exchanger columns for measurement of melamine in pretreated milk samples is shown in Fig. 8 . It can be seen that the flow system with the ion-exchanger columns indeed shows a wider linearity range of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121 and a lower detection limit of 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121, as compared to that without the columns which suffers from serious interference problems and has a rather poor detection limit of 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol L\u22121. Experiments also indicate that the anion-exchanger column should be placed ahead of the cation-exchanger column for the tandem sequence. Such design can avoid the formation of acid solution (pH < 3) when the sample flows through the cation-exchanger column and exchange the co-existing cations with H+ on the resins, which may cause the decomposition of melamine as discussed before. It should be noted that the response slope for measurement of protonated melamine in the pretreated milk samples (\u223c47.2 mV/decade) is a bit lower than that of the standard calibration curve (\u223c54.1 mV/decade) for measurement in buffer solution, which is probably due to the matrix effect caused by the addition of ethanol to the sample solution during the pretreatment procedure.\nThe lifetime of the ion-exchanger column was calculated by the theoretical capacities of the cation-exchanger and anion-exchanger resins (4.2 and 3.0 mequiv. g\u22121, respectively, as reported by the manufacturer). It can be estimated that the ion-exchanger column would be used for ca. 100 times.\nThe flow analysis system based on the MIP based membrane electrode was used to analyze melamine in spiked milk samples which was pretreated with protein removal. The results are given in Table 3 . It can be seen that the recoveries of on-line analysis of milk samples vary from 95% to 110%, indicating that the proposed MIP based sensor flow system has promising feasibility for rapid determination of melamine in complex samples even in the presence of relatively high concentrations of potential interferents.\nA new polymeric membrane ion-selective electrode based on MIP for melamine has been described. Combined with flow analysis, the sensor can be used for measuring melamine in milk samples. The whole analysis including sample pretreatment takes less than 15 min and the detection limit is 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121, which satisfy the needs for on site rapid monitoring of trace melamine in milk. The flow analysis system is promising for use of detection of melamine contamination in other foods such as eggs and animal feeds."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) is a powerful technique for analyzing the spatial distribution of a wide range of biomolecules []. Phospholipids are integral structural and regulatory components of biological membranes, important in cell signaling pathways, and they serve as precursors to many active biomolecules []. Recently, analysis of phospholipids (PLs) by imaging mass spectrometry has been reported []. The study of the distribution of these biomolecules can provide critical insight into relevant biological processes in both healthy and diseased tissue samples.\nCommon methods of depositing matrix for MALDI imaging include robotic spotting [], electrospray deposition [], and spray-coating with an airbrush []. Robotic spotting usually yields high signal quality and very reproducible results, but the image resolution is limited to the size and spacing of the matrix spots. Washing the tissue with ethanol helps to prevent the spreading of the matrix spots, but such a wash cannot be used when analyzing phospholipids. Spray-coating can cause analyte delocalization if the tissue becomes too wet during the application. Also, the matrix crystal size and the homogeneity of the coating can vary significantly from operator to operator. Recently, a protocol using sublimation for matrix deposition has been reported [] that gives a homogeneous coating of matrix essential for obtaining high-resolution phospholipid images from tissue. The sublimation apparatus is relatively simple and is commercially available.\nWe describe a new procedure that involves dry-coating matrix on a tissue section using finely ground crystals of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) filtered through a 20-\u03bcm sieve. Positive ionization mode ion images were acquired at 30- to 100-\u03bcm lateral resolution using a MALDI TOF mass spectrometer. The results show that the dry matrix deposition protocol allows reproducible high-resolution phospholipid images to be obtained.\n2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) was purchased from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ, USA) and ground for 15 min using a mortar and a pestle, yielding crystals between 1 and 40 \u03bcm in diameter. The DHB solution used for the spray-coated comparison experiments was prepared at a concentration of 40 mg/mL using 1:1 ethanol:water solvent. The ethanol was HPLC grade and purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fairlawn, NJ, USA).\nFresh frozen mouse brain samples were used for the imaging experiments. The tissue samples were cut into 12-\u03bcm-thick sagittal sections using a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S) and then thaw-mounted onto gold-coated MALDI plates. The sections were allowed to dry in a vacuum desiccator for 10 min before matrix application. A serial section was cut and mounted on a glass slide and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for anatomical visualization. A 20-\u03bcm stainless steel sieve, a full-height sieve receiving pan, and a sieve cover were purchased from Hogentogler & Co., Inc. (Columbia, MD, USA). The MALDI plate was attached to the bottom of the receiving pan with double-sided tape. A layer of the finely ground DHB was then disbursed over the sieve mesh using a small brush. The sieve was covered and shaken until a uniform DHB layer was deposited over the tissue sections. Excess matrix was removed by briefly directing a burst of clean compressed gas (MicroDuster III, CleanTex, Nanuet, NY, USA) toward the plate from a distance of 20 cm. The matrix application process was repeated three times for optimal coverage and homogeneity. The matrix coverage and crystals sizes were measured with an Olympus BX50 microscope.\nFor comparison, serial sections were prepared using a manual spray-coating technique. A TLC nebulizer (Kontes, Vineland, NJ, USA) with nitrogen gas at 3 psi was used to spray-coat the tissue sections. The DHB solution was repetitively sprayed across the MALDI plate from a distance of 20 cm, allowing 45 s of drying time between the passes, until a uniform matrix coating was achieved on the tissue section.\nMouse brain tissue sections were imaged in the positive ionization mode with an UltraFlex II MALDI TOF-TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) in reflector mode, accumulating 150 laser shots per position at a 100-Hz laser frequency over m/z range of 420 to 1200. The dry-coated images were acquired at 100 \u00d7 100-, 40 \u00d7 50-, and 30 \u00d7 35-\u03bcm raster step sizes using the oversampling technique []. The spray-coated sections were imaged at a 100-\u03bcm step size. The laser intensity was adjusted before each imaging experiment to yield optimal results; generally, the dry-coated sections required 15\u201330% greater laser fluence than the spray-coated sections. The images were created, normalized, and visualized using FlexImaging software.\nWe have assessed the effectiveness of the solvent-free matrix dry-coating procedure for applications involving phospholipid imaging. The DHB crystal size and homogeneity of the matrix coverage were determined by optical microscopy. To control the crystal size deposited onto the tissue sections, we used a 20-\u03bcm sieve filter, resulting in a matrix coating consisting of crystals of 1\u201320 \u03bcm long. The crystal size distribution did not vary much between operators. Figure 1 shows a DHB-coated sagittal mouse brain section and an optical microscope image of the matrix coating on tissue at a magnification of \u00d74. The matrix coating is relatively uniform, with little clustering of the crystals.\nFigure 2 shows a comparison between the solvent-free matrix dry-coating technique described here and a spray-coating method on serial sagittal mouse brain sections. Both sections were imaged at 100-\u03bcm lateral resolution. The average full-scan phospholipid signal obtained with each method as well as overlaid ion images of the potassium salt of phosphatidylcholine (PC) 36:1 at m/z 826 and PC 40:6 at m/z 872 are shown as examples in Figure 2. The MS/MS spectrum of the m/z 826 peak, obtained directly from the dry-coated brain section, is also given. It shows the characteristic phosphocholine signal at m/z 184 and the neutral loss of the choline head group (\u221259 Da) as well as a potassium cyclophosphane peak at m/z 163. A consecutive MALDI spectrum acquired with a Fourier transform mass spectrometer (FTMS) showed a single peak at m/z 826.5723. The accurate mass obtained with the FTMS supports the identification of the species as PC 36:1 (calculated m/z 826.5728). While keeping the sample preparation steps simple and minimizing analyte delocalization, the dry-coating method produced high-quality molecular images showing signal intensity and phospholipid localization similar to those obtained from the spray-coated tissue section.\nFrom each dry-coated imaging experiment, dozens of ion images can be generated that clearly differentiate the anatomical structures of the brain. Several phospholipid images are shown in Figure 3. Some of the regions of the brain that were found to differentially express specific phospholipid distributions are identified in the H&E-stained serial section of the sagittal mouse brain. For example, the peak at m/z 741, which corresponds to potassium salt of sphingomyelin (SM 16:0), was found localized to the fourth and lateral ventricles. MS/MS analyses performed on the dry-coated sections supported the identifications of the phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species indicated in Figure 3. The identifications were confirmed by accurate mass measurements obtained directly from the dry-coated sections using FTMS.\nDry-coating can be used for high-resolution MALDI imaging, which is illustrated in Figure 4. Two sagittal mouse brain sections were dry-coated and the cerebellum regions were imaged at 40 \u00d7 50- and 30 \u00d7 35-\u03bcm lateral resolutions. A serial section was stained with H&E. The overlaid phospholipid images show the localization of PC 40:6 (m/z 872 in light blue), PC 36:1 and PC 38:4 (m/z 826 and 810 in red), and PC 38:6 (m/z 844 in green) in the cerebellar cortex, nucleus, and granule cell layer, respectively.\nIn conclusion, the solvent-free matrix dry-coating approach for phospholipid analysis and imaging can be an attractive alternative to methods that require the matrix to be dissolved in a solvent. With the dry-coating method, there is no significant analyte delocalization. Optimal matrix coverage is achieved when the tissue section is dried in a desiccator for no more than 10 to 15 min before dry-coating, suggesting that some moisture on the tissue aids microscale dissolvation of the surface layers of the matrix crystals. The spatial resolution of the image is limited by the size of the focused laser spot, the size of the individual matrix crystals, and percentage matrix coverage on tissue that, for the experiments reported here, was greater than 80%. The dry-coating procedure is a simple and fast method of producing a homogeneous matrix coating, which in turn can give high-quality phospholipid molecular images.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nIntroduction. Bisphenol A (BPA) is the subject of hot debates regarding \u201clow dose\u201d toxicological effects [1\u20133], i.e., effects at doses clearly below the present tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg/kg body weight [4, 5]. If such effects were proven to be pertinent for human health, exposure to sources so far considered minor might become relevant. Dermal exposure to BPA from thermal printer paper might be such a source.Thermal printer paper includes the printing ink covering the whole surface on the side to be printed. The colorant consists of a leuco dye, i.e., a molecule that can adopt two forms, one of which is colorless. On printing, a thermal head causes the components to melt and react with each other, causing the dye to become dark. Thermal printing papers are regularly used at workplaces like laboratories with recorders using such paper or at cash registers of shops.Kietzmann et al. [6] demonstrated the percutaneous absorption of deuterated BPA by bovine udders, though without concluding a quantitative uptake. Kaddar et al. [7] determined the cutaneous penetration of BPA into and through pig skin in a Franz diffusion cell. After 10\u00a0h, 5.4% of the applied dose (unknown amount in physiological serum) was found on the epidermis, 8.8% in the dermis, and 0.7% in the receptor fluid (totally 14.9%). The experimentation was stopped after 10\u00a0h, \u201cas this is the maximal BPA exposure time for workers\u201d (a statement to be questioned, since BPA remaining on the skin after the work may continue to migrate into the skin).This communication presents data on the transfer of BPA from thermal printer paper to the skin of fingers under various conditions. Some experiments on the uptake by the skin involved the skin of the fingers actually contacting thermal printer paper under conditions as realistic as possible. They provided data for a worst-case scenario, but were not adequate to investigate the extent of uptake into the human metabolism.Materials and methodsSamples of thermal printing papers consisted of receipts from various shops and paper of recorders for chromatographic instruments. Thermal printing paper was identified by its ability to turn dark upon heating. Ethanol absolute, HPLC-grade methanol, and HPLC-grade acetonitrile were from Baker (Deventer, NL).BPA was extracted from thermal paper (100\u00a0mg) by immersion in 10\u00a0ml methanol overnight at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Extracts were diluted 1:1,000 in 10% methanol/water. BPA transferred to fingers was recovered by moving fingers in 10\u00a0ml ethanol for 30\u00a0s. After each experiment, fingers were washed with warm water and soap to extract ethanol. The skin was dried by a towel and for at least several minutes in the air before the next experiment was started.Ethanol extracts were diluted 1:10 with deionized water. BPA was analyzed as described in [8]. Briefly, 500\u00a0\u03bcl diluted extract was injected into a 250\u2009\u00d7\u20094.6-mm-i.d. column packed with Spherisorb ODS-2, 5\u00a0\u03bcm. BPA was eluted with a gradient of 50 to 100% acetonitrile (1\u00a0ml/min). Fluorescence was detected at 226/296\u00a0nm.The limit for quantitation was 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg in 10\u00a0ml ethanol. The response was linear from 0.1 to 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (R2\u2009\u2265\u20090.994). Repeated injections (n\u2009=\u20096) of the same extract (1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) resulted in a relative standard deviation of 4%. The measuring uncertainty was below 10%.ResultsBPA in thermal printer paperTable\u00a01 lists BPA concentrations in 13 samples of thermal printer paper (mean of two determinations). In the 11 samples containing BPA, the mean concentration was 13.3\u00a0g/kg. Two papers did not contain BPA, indicating that such alternatives are available on the market.\nTable\u00a01BPA concentrations in thermal printing paperPaperBPA (g/kg)Receipt train service12Receipt canteen17Receipt shop 116Receipt shop 211Receipt shop 313Receipt shop 417Receipt shop 58Receipt shop 612Receipt shop 715Receipt shop 8<0.0005Recorder 111Recorder 216Tram ticket<0.0005Transfer to the fingersRecovery of BPA from fingers after touching thermal printing paper was checked by repeated extraction. The paper was firmly held with three fingers for 30\u00a0s, with the BPA-containing side contacting the pads of the forefinger and the middle finger. After moving the fingers in ethanol for 3\u00a0s, 2.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was extracted. Immediately afterwards, the same fingers were immersed for an additional 5\u00a0s in fresh ethanol, from which 0.9\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was determined. A third extraction for 22\u00a0s yielded 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA. It was decided to go for an intense extraction by moving the fingers in ethanol during 30 s, which might have included some BPA infiltrated into the surface layer of the skin.The two sides of the paper released very differing amounts of BPA: contacting the printed side transferred 2.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA; that of the rear side 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg (perhaps contaminated by set-off from the printed side).Extraction from fingers not previously used for related experiments released less than 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg BPA. After about 10 experiments including extraction with ethanol, washing with soap and drying, the fingers released traces close to 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg BPA, presumably from deeper skin layers.For the experiments on the transfer of BPA from the paper to the fingers, a \u201cstandard\u201d was defined, from which individual parameters were varied. The standard involved the BPA-containing side of the thermal printing paper being pressed against the pads of the forefinger and the middle finger by the thumb for 5\u00a0s, applying a pressure as needed to pull the paper out of a printer. The skin was slightly greasy (either with natural grease of the skin of the forehead or from briefly touching tissue paper containing some vegetable oil), but not greasy to the extent that it left behind a visible mark on the paper. After each experiment, hands were intensely washed with soap and warm water.Four repeated experiments with recorder papers 1 and 2, containing 11 and 16\u00a0g/kg BPA, respectively (Table\u00a02), transferred 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA with a relative standard deviation of 23% and 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA with a relative standard deviation of 21%, respectively (which is far beyond the uncertainty of the measurement).\nTable\u00a02BPA transferred to fingers under standard conditions (individual measurements for two fingers; mean per finger)PaperBPA content in paper (g/kg)BPA on two fingers (\u03bcg)Mean/finger (\u03bcg)Recorder 1110.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.20.13Recorder 2161.2, 0.9, 1.5. 1.10.6Receipt canteen176.0, 5.03.3Receipt shop 4170.7, 1.30.5Receipt shop 7152.0, 2.21.1Data on the BPA transfer from five thermal printing papers under standard conditions are shown in Table\u00a02. Amounts of BPA found on the fingers were not directly related to the BPA concentration in the paper, which might be due to differing BPA distribution in the paper surface and varying integrity of the fiber layer containing the BPA. The mean transfer on a single finger was 1.13\u00a0\u03bcg.Table\u00a03 shows the influence of the skin properties on the BPA transfer. Compared with the standard (slightly greasy) skin, dry skin resulting from washing with soap and drying for about 5\u00a0min picked up somewhat less BPA from recorder paper 2, but no difference was observed for the receipt of shop 4. The BPA transfer was strongly increased for humid fingers (leaving visible humidity on the paper), e.g., with some saliva as commonly applied to better grip paper. After this kind of contact, a whitish stain was visible on the finger, suggesting that a surface layer of the paper disintegrated and was transferred to the skin. With wet skin, softened in warm water and just shaken to remove the excess water, transfer was still higher. Oily fingers (leaving a visible mark on the paper) also increased the transfer to about 10\u00a0\u03bcg. No whitish stain was observed on the finger pads, suggesting that transfer to oily fingers occurred by extraction of BPA from the paper rather than from dissolved fiber structure.\nTable\u00a03Transfer of BPA to two fingers depending on skin properties (papers according to Table\u00a01; individual measurements)BPA on two fingers (\u03bcg)Recorder 2Shop 4Standard (slightly greasy skin)1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.10.7, 1.3Dry skin after washing and drying0.7, 0.61.0, 0.6Humid finger7, 28Wet fingers46, 36Oily finger14, 911, 7Table\u00a04 reports amounts of BPA transferred to the two fingers with standard slightly greasy skin surface, but varying the mode of holding the paper (recorder paper 2). Keeping the paper at standard pressure for only 1\u00a0s caused the transfer to be reduced by a factor of about three. Holding it for 5\u00a0s at the minimal pressure to prevent it falling resulted in poorly reproduced lower transfer. Perhaps against intuition, pulling the paper through the fingers with standard pressure for 5\u00a0s also yielded a smaller transfer, which suggests that abrasion of the surface layer was not relevant for normal skin and transfer was primarily via extraction into the skin. Holding prolonged to 60\u00a0s was similar to the standard conditions, which means that the skin was saturated in less than 5\u00a0s.\nTable\u00a04BPA transfer to two fingers depending on the mode of holding the paper (individual results)Mode of holding paperBPA on finger (\u03bcg)Holding 1\u00a0s0.4, 0.3Holding 5\u00a0s, standard1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.1\u00a0Low pressure0.7, 0.2\u00a0Pulling paper through fingers0.6, 0.8Holding 60\u00a0s1.5, 0.7Table\u00a05 reports on the effect of repeated contact with always fresh spots of recorder paper 2. Three or even ten standard contacts did not increase the amount of BPA on the skin, which suggests that equilibrium between the BPA concentration in the paper and the surface layer of the skin was reached. In practice it means that a person working at a cash register and touching a receipt every few minutes does not accumulate more BPA than another person touching such paper much less frequently. The last experiment tested the reverse situation: after a standard contact, a clean paper was contacted (5\u00a0s, same pressure) at three different spots, checking whether this would transfer BPA back to paper. Interestingly, the amount of BPA on the finger did not decrease significantly: the BPA seemed to firmly adhere to the skin surface, which in practice means that the person at a cash register is unlikely to transfer substantial amounts of BPA to the food packs or other surfaces. These data suggest that the amount of BPA on the contaminated skin surface remains fairly constant.\nTable\u00a05BPA transfer during repeated contactsNumber of contactsBPA on finger (\u03bcg)1 (standard)1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.131.1, .9101.3, 0.71, then 3 with clean paper1.0, 0.7Experiments regarding the penetration into or through the skinOf 10\u00a0\u03bcg BPA applied to a finger as a solution in ethanol (10\u00a0\u03bcl, 1\u00a0mg/ml), extraction by ethanol shortly after evaporation of the solvent recovered 95%. Recovery 90\u00a0min after application, however, was below the detection limit, i.e., corresponded to less than 5% of the amount applied. With a 60-min interval between application and extraction, 10% was recovered. Evaporation of BPA from the skin was ruled out by wrapping aluminum foil tightly around the finger (including extraction of the latter for determining potential transfer from the warm finger to the cooler foil). It is assumed that the BPA which cannot be extracted with ethanol during 30\u00a0s can no longer be washed off and either remains in the skin surface until the stratum corneum is removed or migrates into and perhaps through the dermis.The experiment was repeated by applying 1\u00a0\u03bcl of a 10\u00a0mg/ml BPA solution to the finger pad, i.e., the same amount of BPA in ten times less ethanol, varying the interval between the application and the extraction from 5 to 90\u00a0min. After some 15\u00a0min only half of the BPA was recovered, but some 40% remained extractable with ethanol even after 1.5\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a01; mean values from two experiments). This indicates that ethanol was a vector supporting the penetration of the skin surface.\nFig.\u00a01BPA recovered by extraction of the skin with ethanol after the times shown on the x-axis; 10\u00a0\u03bcg BPA in 1\u00a0\u03bcl of ethanol applied to a finger padThe next experiment was performed without ethanol: recorder paper 2 was touched with the wet forefinger and middle finger for 5\u00a0s. BPA on the forefinger was extracted with ethanol either immediately, or with a delay of 20 or 60\u00a0min. Then the hand was washed with soap and cold or hot water, rubbing the contaminated middle finger, and BPA on the middle finger was also extracted with ethanol. The recovered amounts of BPA in the left column of Table\u00a06 indicate that the amount of BPA directly extracted with ethanol did not significantly decrease with a delay of up to 60\u00a0min (with a high uncertainty resulting from the difficulty in reproducibly transferring a given amount of BPA in this way). After washing with cold water, some 5\u20138% of the BPA was recovered by ethanol. After washing with warm water, it was clearly less. There was no significant increase in the amount of BPA only recoverable with ethanol after a longer waiting period which would have supported progressive penetration of BPA deeper into the skin. It was concluded that the relatively large amount of BPA transferred to wet fingers remained on the surface and was largely removable by (intense) washing. This might be explained by a large part of the BPA being located in particles which are in only loose contact with the skin.\nTable 6BPA transferred onto fingers by wet contact; amounts extractable with ethanol directly or after washing with soap and cold or warm water, either immediately after contacting recorder paper 2 or after waiting 20 or 60 minDirect extraction (\u03bcg)WashingExtraction after washing (\u03bcg)Recovered residue in skin (%)Cold water 46Immediately2.55.4 36After 20 min38.3 44After 60 min3.17.0Warm water 18, 33Immediately0.2, 0.41.1, 1.2 36, 25After 20 min0.1, 0.50.3, 2.0 22, 29After 60 min0.8, 0.33.6, 1.0Similar experiments involved standard dry skin on which no particles seemed to adhere (with a correspondingly lower transfer). In the first experiment, the four fingers of both hands except the thumb were brought into contact with recorder paper 2 using gentle pressure. BPA on the fingers of one hand was immediately extracted with ethanol, BPA of the other 2\u00a0h later. The amounts extracted after 2\u00a0h were not significantly lower (Table\u00a07; the recovery for the sum of the four fingers was calculated as 88%). This also indicates that BPA\u2014in presumably more intimate skin contact\u2014after touching the paper with dry fingers remained on the skin surface to a far higher proportion than after application in ethanol.\nTable\u00a07BPA transferred onto dry fingers by contacting recorder paper 2; extraction with ethanol immediately afterwards or 2\u00a0h laterExtractionEthanol extraction of BPA (\u03bcg)ForefingerMiddle fingerRing fingerLittle fingerSumImmediately0.60.71.113.4After 2\u00a0h0.60.810.63Recovery (%)88In the second, analogous experiment, the hands were washed with soap and warm water immediately after contacting the paper with the forefinger and the middle finger of both hands, then BPA was individually extracted from each finger with ethanol. None of the fingers released a detectable amount of BPA into ethanol (<0.05\u00a0\u03bcg; Table\u00a08), which means that from the roughly 0.6\u00a0\u03bcg BPA transferred to a finger in this way (Tables\u00a03 and 7), more than 90% was removed by washing. The same procedure was repeated by washing the fingers only 2\u00a0h after contacting the paper. Now the ethanol extracted measurable amounts of BPA (mean of 0.17\u00a0\u03bcg), i.e., washing only removed 73% of the BPA. This indicates that during the 2\u00a0h about 0.17\u00a0\u03bcg BPA migrated into the skin of a finger to such a depth that it was no longer removable by water.\nTable\u00a08BPA extracted with ethanol from fingers after contacting thermal printer paper and washing either immediately or after 2\u00a0hExtracted BPA (\u03bcg/finger)Immediate extraction<0.05, <0.05,<0.05,<0.05Extraction after 2\u00a0h0.2, 0.2, 0.06, 0.2Basically this experiment was not conclusive in as far as the amount of BPA penetrating the skin could have been larger than that detected by ethanol extraction (see experiment with BPA applied with ethanol, where after 90\u00a0min the BPA was no longer extractable with ethanol). However, in this experiment the amount no longer extractable by ethanol must have been small, as shown by the high recovery shown in Table\u00a07.DiscussionOn average, holding thermal printing paper transferred 1.13\u00a0\u03bcg BPA to the pad of a finger touching the BPA-containing side. Humid or very greasy skin easily picked up ten times more (maximum 23\u00a0\u03bcg/finger). The highest transfer with wet fingers involves particulate matter, i.e., fibers and particles from the disintegrated paper surface. Such BPA adhering to the skin via particles is rather easily removed by abrasion and it is not in as intimate contact with the skin as when it is dissolved in the skin surface itself.Touching a paper consecutively at several spots with normal (neither humid nor oily) skin did not increase the transfer, nor did touching BPA-free paper significantly decrease it, suggesting that staff regularly in contact with such paper, e.g., at a register desk, have a fairly constant amount of BPA on the skin all day long. When all ten finger pads occasionally contact thermal printer paper, on average a total of 11\u00a0\u03bcg BPA would be on the skin. This amount can easily be increased by an order of magnitude when a larger surface of the hand gets into contact with the BPA from the paper, e.g., when thermal printer paper is rumpled.The experiments did not enable us to determine whether or not BPA passes through the skin into the human metabolism, but they did show that BPA can enter the skin to a depth such that it is no longer removable by washing hands. Such BPA either remains in the skin up to the renewal of the latter or migrates deeper and eventually reaches body fluid. There is ample time for the latter process once BPA can no longer be washed off.BPA applied to the finger pad with ethanol rapidly entered the skin to such an extent that after about 1\u00a0h it was no longer extractable even with ethanol for 30\u00a0s. Absorption of BPA transferred from paper was far weaker: after 2\u00a0h, most of the BPA could still be washed off. Hence uptake depends on a vector. Hand creams could be such vectors.Two hours after contacting thermal printer paper with dry skin, 27% of the BPA picked up could no longer be washed off by water, but was still extractable with ethanol. For the given paper this meant a corresponding uptake by the skin of 0.09\u00a0\u03bcg BPA per hour and finger. In a worst-case scenario this amount would finally enter the human metabolism. In a further elaboration of this scenario it could be assumed that all eight fingers and two thumbs of a person pick up BPA in this way. If the thermal printer paper transferring the highest amount of BPA (the receipt from the canteen; Table\u00a02) is touched frequently enough to maintain about 3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA on each finger pad (at least once every few hours), the uptake into the skin via ten digits during a working day of 10\u00a0h would be 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00a0h\u2009\u00d7\u2009(27% of 3\u00a0\u03bcg)/2\u00a0h\u2009=\u200941\u00a0\u03bcg. If the hands are not washed before going home, the 30\u00a0\u03bcg BPA left on the ten digits could also be resorbed, increasing the maximum exposure to 71\u00a0\u03bcg/day.The estimated potential exposure of 71\u00a0\u03bcg/day for normal skin is 42 times below the 3,000\u00a0\u03bcg/day that are derived from the present TDI using the normally assumed 60\u00a0kg body weight or eight times below the amount which is assumed to be safe by present European specific migration limit (SML of 0.6\u00a0mg/kg; EU-Directive 2002/72). The scenario took into account the highest transfer to the skin from the five thermal printer papers tested, but does not really consider the worst case, such as a contact with a much larger skin surface or the use of hand creams that increase the permeability of the skin. Each of these could increase exposure by a factor of ten.On the basis of the present TDI, thermal printer paper with BPA can probably be considered safe even for these reasonable worst cases, but it should be reconsidered more carefully once \u201clow dose\u201d effects are taken into account for risk assessment: it could cause far higher exposure than known for food.References1.European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food on a request from the Commission related to 2,2-bis(4-hydroxphenyl)propane (bisphenol A) question number EFSA-Q-2005\u2013100, adopted on 29 November 2006The EFSA Journal20064281752.NTP (2008) NTP-CERHR monograph on the potential human reproductive and developmental effects of bisphenol A, September 2008, NIH Publication No. 08 \u2013 59943.MyersJPEnviron Health Perspect20091173093141:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXjvVWmur4%3D4.EFSAOpinion of the Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food on bisphenol AThe EFSA Journal20064281755.EFSAOpinion on the toxicokinetics of bisphenol AThe EFSA Journal20087591106.KietzmannMKr\u00e4nkePM\u00f6derMSchraderSWahrenMIsotopes Environ Health Stud19993512713410.1080/102560199082340851:CAS:528:DC%2BD3cXmsVCn7.KaddarNHarth\u00e9CD\u00e9chaudHMappusEPugeatMJ Toxicol Environ Health20087147147310.1080/152873908019068241:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXjtFSisLo%3D8.Biedermann-BremSGrobKFjeldalPEur Food Res Technol20082271053106010.1007/s00217-008-0819-91:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXotVyltbs%3D\n\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

These effects are seen as potentially relevant for human health, even at doses clearly below the present tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg/kg body weight.\n\nQ2: How is BPA exposure assessed in the study? \nA2: The study used samples of thermal printing papers, which include the printing ink covering the whole surface on the side to be printed. The colorant consists of a leuco dye, which is a molecule that can adopt two forms, one of which is colorless. On printing, a thermal head causes the components to melt and react with each other, causing the dye to become dark. \n\nQ3: What were the BPA concentrations found in the thermal printer paper samples?\nA3: The BPA concentrations in the thermal printing paper samples ranged from 13.3\u00a0g/kg to 16.0\u00a0g/kg. Two papers did not contain BPA, indicating that such alternatives are available on the market.\n\nQ4: How was the BPA transferred from the thermal printer paper to the skin of fingers?\nA4: The BPA was transferred from the thermal printer paper to the skin of fingers through direct contact. The study used a \"standard\" scenario, from which individual parameters were varied to investigate the extent of uptake into the human metabolism.\n\nQ5: What factors influenced the BPA transfer? \nA5: The study found that the amount of BPA transferred depended on several factors, including the skin properties and the mode of holding the paper. For example, dry skin picked up less BPA from the paper, while humid fingers (with some saliva) easily transferred ten times more BPA. \n\nQ6: How much BPA can a person working at a cash register expect to have on their skin? \nA6: According to the study, a person who regularly touches thermal printer paper, such as at a cash register, would have a fairly constant amount of BPA on their skin all day long. On average, this added up to 11\u00a0\u03bcg BPA per finger. \n\nQ7: Did the experiments prove that BPA passes through the skin into the human metabolism? \nA7: The experiments did not directly prove that BPA passes through the skin into the human metabolism, but they did show that BPA can enter the skin to a depth such that it is no longer removable by washing hands. \n\nQ8: What was the highest transfer of BPA to the skin in the experiments? \nA8: The highest transfer of BPA to the skin was recorded in an experiment where thermal printer paper with a BPA concentration of 16.0\u00a0g/kg was touched for 5 seconds with slightly greasy skin. In this scenario, 2.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was transferred. \n\nQ9: How much BPA remains on the skin after washing? \nA9: According to the study, a significant amount of BPA can remain on the skin even after washing. In an experiment where 10\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was applied to a finger as a solution in ethanol and then washed with soap and warm water, only 0.7% of the BPA was recovered. \n\nQ10: Based on the paper, is thermal printer paper with BPA safe for use? \nA10: The paper suggests that thermal printer paper with BPA can probably be considered safe for reasonable worst cases, based on the present Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI). However, it suggests that the risk assessment should be reconsidered once \u201clow dose\u201d effects are taken into account.",

        "txt": "Introduction. Bisphenol A (BPA) is the subject of hot debates regarding \u201clow dose\u201d toxicological effects [1\u20133], i.e., effects at doses clearly below the present tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg/kg body weight [4, 5]. If such effects were proven to be pertinent for human health, exposure to sources so far considered minor might become relevant. Dermal exposure to BPA from thermal printer paper might be such a source.Thermal printer paper includes the printing ink covering the whole surface on the side to be printed. The colorant consists of a leuco dye, i.e., a molecule that can adopt two forms, one of which is colorless. On printing, a thermal head causes the components to melt and react with each other, causing the dye to become dark. Thermal printing papers are regularly used at workplaces like laboratories with recorders using such paper or at cash registers of shops.Kietzmann et al. [6] demonstrated the percutaneous absorption of deuterated BPA by bovine udders, though without concluding a quantitative uptake. Kaddar et al. [7] determined the cutaneous penetration of BPA into and through pig skin in a Franz diffusion cell. After 10\u00a0h, 5.4% of the applied dose (unknown amount in physiological serum) was found on the epidermis, 8.8% in the dermis, and 0.7% in the receptor fluid (totally 14.9%). The experimentation was stopped after 10\u00a0h, \u201cas this is the maximal BPA exposure time for workers\u201d (a statement to be questioned, since BPA remaining on the skin after the work may continue to migrate into the skin).This communication presents data on the transfer of BPA from thermal printer paper to the skin of fingers under various conditions. Some experiments on the uptake by the skin involved the skin of the fingers actually contacting thermal printer paper under conditions as realistic as possible. They provided data for a worst-case scenario, but were not adequate to investigate the extent of uptake into the human metabolism.Materials and methodsSamples of thermal printing papers consisted of receipts from various shops and paper of recorders for chromatographic instruments. Thermal printing paper was identified by its ability to turn dark upon heating. Ethanol absolute, HPLC-grade methanol, and HPLC-grade acetonitrile were from Baker (Deventer, NL).BPA was extracted from thermal paper (100\u00a0mg) by immersion in 10\u00a0ml methanol overnight at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Extracts were diluted 1:1,000 in 10% methanol/water. BPA transferred to fingers was recovered by moving fingers in 10\u00a0ml ethanol for 30\u00a0s. After each experiment, fingers were washed with warm water and soap to extract ethanol. The skin was dried by a towel and for at least several minutes in the air before the next experiment was started.Ethanol extracts were diluted 1:10 with deionized water. BPA was analyzed as described in [8]. Briefly, 500\u00a0\u03bcl diluted extract was injected into a 250\u2009\u00d7\u20094.6-mm-i.d. column packed with Spherisorb ODS-2, 5\u00a0\u03bcm. BPA was eluted with a gradient of 50 to 100% acetonitrile (1\u00a0ml/min). Fluorescence was detected at 226/296\u00a0nm.The limit for quantitation was 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg in 10\u00a0ml ethanol. The response was linear from 0.1 to 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (R2\u2009\u2265\u20090.994). Repeated injections (n\u2009=\u20096) of the same extract (1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) resulted in a relative standard deviation of 4%. The measuring uncertainty was below 10%.ResultsBPA in thermal printer paperTable\u00a01 lists BPA concentrations in 13 samples of thermal printer paper (mean of two determinations). In the 11 samples containing BPA, the mean concentration was 13.3\u00a0g/kg. Two papers did not contain BPA, indicating that such alternatives are available on the market.\nTable\u00a01BPA concentrations in thermal printing paperPaperBPA (g/kg)Receipt train service12Receipt canteen17Receipt shop 116Receipt shop 211Receipt shop 313Receipt shop 417Receipt shop 58Receipt shop 612Receipt shop 715Receipt shop 8<0.0005Recorder 111Recorder 216Tram ticket<0.0005Transfer to the fingersRecovery of BPA from fingers after touching thermal printing paper was checked by repeated extraction. The paper was firmly held with three fingers for 30\u00a0s, with the BPA-containing side contacting the pads of the forefinger and the middle finger. After moving the fingers in ethanol for 3\u00a0s, 2.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was extracted. Immediately afterwards, the same fingers were immersed for an additional 5\u00a0s in fresh ethanol, from which 0.9\u00a0\u03bcg BPA was determined. A third extraction for 22\u00a0s yielded 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA. It was decided to go for an intense extraction by moving the fingers in ethanol during 30 s, which might have included some BPA infiltrated into the surface layer of the skin.The two sides of the paper released very differing amounts of BPA: contacting the printed side transferred 2.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA; that of the rear side 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg (perhaps contaminated by set-off from the printed side).Extraction from fingers not previously used for related experiments released less than 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg BPA. After about 10 experiments including extraction with ethanol, washing with soap and drying, the fingers released traces close to 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg BPA, presumably from deeper skin layers.For the experiments on the transfer of BPA from the paper to the fingers, a \u201cstandard\u201d was defined, from which individual parameters were varied. The standard involved the BPA-containing side of the thermal printing paper being pressed against the pads of the forefinger and the middle finger by the thumb for 5\u00a0s, applying a pressure as needed to pull the paper out of a printer. The skin was slightly greasy (either with natural grease of the skin of the forehead or from briefly touching tissue paper containing some vegetable oil), but not greasy to the extent that it left behind a visible mark on the paper. After each experiment, hands were intensely washed with soap and warm water.Four repeated experiments with recorder papers 1 and 2, containing 11 and 16\u00a0g/kg BPA, respectively (Table\u00a02), transferred 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA with a relative standard deviation of 23% and 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg BPA with a relative standard deviation of 21%, respectively (which is far beyond the uncertainty of the measurement).\nTable\u00a02BPA transferred to fingers under standard conditions (individual measurements for two fingers; mean per finger)PaperBPA content in paper (g/kg)BPA on two fingers (\u03bcg)Mean/finger (\u03bcg)Recorder 1110.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.20.13Recorder 2161.2, 0.9, 1.5. 1.10.6Receipt canteen176.0, 5.03.3Receipt shop 4170.7, 1.30.5Receipt shop 7152.0, 2.21.1Data on the BPA transfer from five thermal printing papers under standard conditions are shown in Table\u00a02. Amounts of BPA found on the fingers were not directly related to the BPA concentration in the paper, which might be due to differing BPA distribution in the paper surface and varying integrity of the fiber layer containing the BPA. The mean transfer on a single finger was 1.13\u00a0\u03bcg.Table\u00a03 shows the influence of the skin properties on the BPA transfer. Compared with the standard (slightly greasy) skin, dry skin resulting from washing with soap and drying for about 5\u00a0min picked up somewhat less BPA from recorder paper 2, but no difference was observed for the receipt of shop 4. The BPA transfer was strongly increased for humid fingers (leaving visible humidity on the paper), e.g., with some saliva as commonly applied to better grip paper. After this kind of contact, a whitish stain was visible on the finger, suggesting that a surface layer of the paper disintegrated and was transferred to the skin. With wet skin, softened in warm water and just shaken to remove the excess water, transfer was still higher. Oily fingers (leaving a visible mark on the paper) also increased the transfer to about 10\u00a0\u03bcg. No whitish stain was observed on the finger pads, suggesting that transfer to oily fingers occurred by extraction of BPA from the paper rather than from dissolved fiber structure.\nTable\u00a03Transfer of BPA to two fingers depending on skin properties (papers according to Table\u00a01; individual measurements)BPA on two fingers (\u03bcg)Recorder 2Shop 4Standard (slightly greasy skin)1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.10.7, 1.3Dry skin after washing and drying0.7, 0.61.0, 0.6Humid finger7, 28Wet fingers46, 36Oily finger14, 911, 7Table\u00a04 reports amounts of BPA transferred to the two fingers with standard slightly greasy skin surface, but varying the mode of holding the paper (recorder paper 2). Keeping the paper at standard pressure for only 1\u00a0s caused the transfer to be reduced by a factor of about three. Holding it for 5\u00a0s at the minimal pressure to prevent it falling resulted in poorly reproduced lower transfer. Perhaps against intuition, pulling the paper through the fingers with standard pressure for 5\u00a0s also yielded a smaller transfer, which suggests that abrasion of the surface layer was not relevant for normal skin and transfer was primarily via extraction into the skin. Holding prolonged to 60\u00a0s was similar to the standard conditions, which means that the skin was saturated in less than 5\u00a0s.\nTable\u00a04BPA transfer to two fingers depending on the mode of holding the paper (individual results)Mode of holding paperBPA on finger (\u03bcg)Holding 1\u00a0s0.4, 0.3Holding 5\u00a0s, standard1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.1\u00a0Low pressure0.7, 0.2\u00a0Pulling paper through fingers0.6, 0.8Holding 60\u00a0s1.5, 0.7Table\u00a05 reports on the effect of repeated contact with always fresh spots of recorder paper 2. Three or even ten standard contacts did not increase the amount of BPA on the skin, which suggests that equilibrium between the BPA concentration in the paper and the surface layer of the skin was reached. In practice it means that a person working at a cash register and touching a receipt every few minutes does not accumulate more BPA than another person touching such paper much less frequently. The last experiment tested the reverse situation: after a standard contact, a clean paper was contacted (5\u00a0s, same pressure) at three different spots, checking whether this would transfer BPA back to paper. Interestingly, the amount of BPA on the finger did not decrease significantly: the BPA seemed to firmly adhere to the skin surface, which in practice means that the person at a cash register is unlikely to transfer substantial amounts of BPA to the food packs or other surfaces. These data suggest that the amount of BPA on the contaminated skin surface remains fairly constant.\nTable\u00a05BPA transfer during repeated contactsNumber of contactsBPA on finger (\u03bcg)1 (standard)1.2, 0.9, 1.5, 1.131.1, .9101.3, 0.71, then 3 with clean paper1.0, 0.7Experiments regarding the penetration into or through the skinOf 10\u00a0\u03bcg BPA applied to a finger as a solution in ethanol (10\u00a0\u03bcl, 1\u00a0mg/ml), extraction by ethanol shortly after evaporation of the solvent recovered 95%. Recovery 90\u00a0min after application, however, was below the detection limit, i.e., corresponded to less than 5% of the amount applied. With a 60-min interval between application and extraction, 10% was recovered. Evaporation of BPA from the skin was ruled out by wrapping aluminum foil tightly around the finger (including extraction of the latter for determining potential transfer from the warm finger to the cooler foil). It is assumed that the BPA which cannot be extracted with ethanol during 30\u00a0s can no longer be washed off and either remains in the skin surface until the stratum corneum is removed or migrates into and perhaps through the dermis.The experiment was repeated by applying 1\u00a0\u03bcl of a 10\u00a0mg/ml BPA solution to the finger pad, i.e., the same amount of BPA in ten times less ethanol, varying the interval between the application and the extraction from 5 to 90\u00a0min. After some 15\u00a0min only half of the BPA was recovered, but some 40% remained extractable with ethanol even after 1.5\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a01; mean values from two experiments). This indicates that ethanol was a vector supporting the penetration of the skin surface.\nFig.\u00a01BPA recovered by extraction of the skin with ethanol after the times shown on the x-axis; 10\u00a0\u03bcg BPA in 1\u00a0\u03bcl of ethanol applied to a finger padThe next experiment was performed without ethanol: recorder paper 2 was touched with the wet forefinger and middle finger for 5\u00a0s. BPA on the forefinger was extracted with ethanol either immediately, or with a delay of 20 or 60\u00a0min. Then the hand was washed with soap and cold or hot water, rubbing the contaminated middle finger, and BPA on the middle finger was also extracted with ethanol. The recovered amounts of BPA in the left column of Table\u00a06 indicate that the amount of BPA directly extracted with ethanol did not significantly decrease with a delay of up to 60\u00a0min (with a high uncertainty resulting from the difficulty in reproducibly transferring a given amount of BPA in this way). After washing with cold water, some 5\u20138% of the BPA was recovered by ethanol. After washing with warm water, it was clearly less. There was no significant increase in the amount of BPA only recoverable with ethanol after a longer waiting period which would have supported progressive penetration of BPA deeper into the skin. It was concluded that the relatively large amount of BPA transferred to wet fingers remained on the surface and was largely removable by (intense) washing. This might be explained by a large part of the BPA being located in particles which are in only loose contact with the skin.\nTable 6BPA transferred onto fingers by wet contact; amounts extractable with ethanol directly or after washing with soap and cold or warm water, either immediately after contacting recorder paper 2 or after waiting 20 or 60 minDirect extraction (\u03bcg)WashingExtraction after washing (\u03bcg)Recovered residue in skin (%)Cold water 46Immediately2.55.4 36After 20 min38.3 44After 60 min3.17.0Warm water 18, 33Immediately0.2, 0.41.1, 1.2 36, 25After 20 min0.1, 0.50.3, 2.0 22, 29After 60 min0.8, 0.33.6, 1.0Similar experiments involved standard dry skin on which no particles seemed to adhere (with a correspondingly lower transfer). In the first experiment, the four fingers of both hands except the thumb were brought into contact with recorder paper 2 using gentle pressure. BPA on the fingers of one hand was immediately extracted with ethanol, BPA of the other 2\u00a0h later. The amounts extracted after 2\u00a0h were not significantly lower (Table\u00a07; the recovery for the sum of the four fingers was calculated as 88%). This also indicates that BPA\u2014in presumably more intimate skin contact\u2014after touching the paper with dry fingers remained on the skin surface to a far higher proportion than after application in ethanol.\nTable\u00a07BPA transferred onto dry fingers by contacting recorder paper 2; extraction with ethanol immediately afterwards or 2\u00a0h laterExtractionEthanol extraction of BPA (\u03bcg)ForefingerMiddle fingerRing fingerLittle fingerSumImmediately0.60.71.113.4After 2\u00a0h0.60.810.63Recovery (%)88In the second, analogous experiment, the hands were washed with soap and warm water immediately after contacting the paper with the forefinger and the middle finger of both hands, then BPA was individually extracted from each finger with ethanol. None of the fingers released a detectable amount of BPA into ethanol (<0.05\u00a0\u03bcg; Table\u00a08), which means that from the roughly 0.6\u00a0\u03bcg BPA transferred to a finger in this way (Tables\u00a03 and 7), more than 90% was removed by washing. The same procedure was repeated by washing the fingers only 2\u00a0h after contacting the paper. Now the ethanol extracted measurable amounts of BPA (mean of 0.17\u00a0\u03bcg), i.e., washing only removed 73% of the BPA. This indicates that during the 2\u00a0h about 0.17\u00a0\u03bcg BPA migrated into the skin of a finger to such a depth that it was no longer removable by water.\nTable\u00a08BPA extracted with ethanol from fingers after contacting thermal printer paper and washing either immediately or after 2\u00a0hExtracted BPA (\u03bcg/finger)Immediate extraction<0.05, <0.05,<0.05,<0.05Extraction after 2\u00a0h0.2, 0.2, 0.06, 0.2Basically this experiment was not conclusive in as far as the amount of BPA penetrating the skin could have been larger than that detected by ethanol extraction (see experiment with BPA applied with ethanol, where after 90\u00a0min the BPA was no longer extractable with ethanol). However, in this experiment the amount no longer extractable by ethanol must have been small, as shown by the high recovery shown in Table\u00a07.DiscussionOn average, holding thermal printing paper transferred 1.13\u00a0\u03bcg BPA to the pad of a finger touching the BPA-containing side. Humid or very greasy skin easily picked up ten times more (maximum 23\u00a0\u03bcg/finger). The highest transfer with wet fingers involves particulate matter, i.e., fibers and particles from the disintegrated paper surface. Such BPA adhering to the skin via particles is rather easily removed by abrasion and it is not in as intimate contact with the skin as when it is dissolved in the skin surface itself.Touching a paper consecutively at several spots with normal (neither humid nor oily) skin did not increase the transfer, nor did touching BPA-free paper significantly decrease it, suggesting that staff regularly in contact with such paper, e.g., at a register desk, have a fairly constant amount of BPA on the skin all day long. When all ten finger pads occasionally contact thermal printer paper, on average a total of 11\u00a0\u03bcg BPA would be on the skin. This amount can easily be increased by an order of magnitude when a larger surface of the hand gets into contact with the BPA from the paper, e.g., when thermal printer paper is rumpled.The experiments did not enable us to determine whether or not BPA passes through the skin into the human metabolism, but they did show that BPA can enter the skin to a depth such that it is no longer removable by washing hands. Such BPA either remains in the skin up to the renewal of the latter or migrates deeper and eventually reaches body fluid. There is ample time for the latter process once BPA can no longer be washed off.BPA applied to the finger pad with ethanol rapidly entered the skin to such an extent that after about 1\u00a0h it was no longer extractable even with ethanol for 30\u00a0s. Absorption of BPA transferred from paper was far weaker: after 2\u00a0h, most of the BPA could still be washed off. Hence uptake depends on a vector. Hand creams could be such vectors.Two hours after contacting thermal printer paper with dry skin, 27% of the BPA picked up could no longer be washed off by water, but was still extractable with ethanol. For the given paper this meant a corresponding uptake by the skin of 0.09\u00a0\u03bcg BPA per hour and finger. In a worst-case scenario this amount would finally enter the human metabolism. In a further elaboration of this scenario it could be assumed that all eight fingers and two thumbs of a person pick up BPA in this way. If the thermal printer paper transferring the highest amount of BPA (the receipt from the canteen; Table\u00a02) is touched frequently enough to maintain about 3\u00a0\u03bcg BPA on each finger pad (at least once every few hours), the uptake into the skin via ten digits during a working day of 10\u00a0h would be 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00a0h\u2009\u00d7\u2009(27% of 3\u00a0\u03bcg)/2\u00a0h\u2009=\u200941\u00a0\u03bcg. If the hands are not washed before going home, the 30\u00a0\u03bcg BPA left on the ten digits could also be resorbed, increasing the maximum exposure to 71\u00a0\u03bcg/day.The estimated potential exposure of 71\u00a0\u03bcg/day for normal skin is 42 times below the 3,000\u00a0\u03bcg/day that are derived from the present TDI using the normally assumed 60\u00a0kg body weight or eight times below the amount which is assumed to be safe by present European specific migration limit (SML of 0.6\u00a0mg/kg; EU-Directive 2002/72). The scenario took into account the highest transfer to the skin from the five thermal printer papers tested, but does not really consider the worst case, such as a contact with a much larger skin surface or the use of hand creams that increase the permeability of the skin. Each of these could increase exposure by a factor of ten.On the basis of the present TDI, thermal printer paper with BPA can probably be considered safe even for these reasonable worst cases, but it should be reconsidered more carefully once \u201clow dose\u201d effects are taken into account for risk assessment: it could cause far higher exposure than known for food.References1.European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food on a request from the Commission related to 2,2-bis(4-hydroxphenyl)propane (bisphenol A) question number EFSA-Q-2005\u2013100, adopted on 29 November 2006The EFSA Journal20064281752.NTP (2008) NTP-CERHR monograph on the potential human reproductive and developmental effects of bisphenol A, September 2008, NIH Publication No. 08 \u2013 59943.MyersJPEnviron Health Perspect20091173093141:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXjvVWmur4%3D4.EFSAOpinion of the Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food on bisphenol AThe EFSA Journal20064281755.EFSAOpinion on the toxicokinetics of bisphenol AThe EFSA Journal20087591106.KietzmannMKr\u00e4nkePM\u00f6derMSchraderSWahrenMIsotopes Environ Health Stud19993512713410.1080/102560199082340851:CAS:528:DC%2BD3cXmsVCn7.KaddarNHarth\u00e9CD\u00e9chaudHMappusEPugeatMJ Toxicol Environ Health20087147147310.1080/152873908019068241:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXjtFSisLo%3D8.Biedermann-BremSGrobKFjeldalPEur Food Res Technol20082271053106010.1007/s00217-008-0819-91:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXotVyltbs%3D\n"

Recently, much attention has been directed to the use of low dimensional nanostructures such as nanoparticles, nanowires (NWs), and nanotubes, as building blocks in the production of hierarchical nanostructures because of various novel applications. Lieber and colleagues developed a technique for a large-scale hierarchical organization of NWs arrays for integrated nanosystems , whereas Wang and colleagues reported that novel hierarchical nanostructures based on NWs can be used as solar-cells and nanogenerators . Due to characteristic high porosity of hierarchical nanostructures, they also have been studied as photocatalysts and gas sensors . Gas sensing properties of hierarchical nanostructures from metal oxides have been comprehensively reviewed by Lee . To date, the synthesis of hierarchical nanostructures from metal oxides can be classified into three categories. The first method involves high thermal evaporation of precursor powders accompanied by a low-temperature condensation. One-step and multi-steps of the thermal evaporation processes have been employed in the synthesis of different hierarchical nanostructures such as ZnO\u2013ZnO , ZnO\u2013SnO2 , SnO2\u2013SnO2 , and ZnO\u2013In2O3 , and WO3 . The second technique is a wet-chemical route, which is simple, environmentally friendly, operated low-temperatures, inexpensive, and products high-throughput . The third option is a combination of the first two methods . It can be recognized that the hierarchization strategy consists of two-step vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) growths are frequently used because the hierarchical NWs can be precisely controlled through the thermal evaporation steps. The first step is to grow the core NWs and the second step is to grow the outer NWs by reseeding of nanoparticle catalysts on the core NWs surface.\nPrevious studies have reported that hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures are relatively good gas sensors . More or less, the gas sensing properties of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures prepared by a two-step thermal evaporation process can be enhanced by the deposition of the gold nanoparticles in the core NWs before the second step of the thermal evaporation process. This is likely the materials are functionalized with catalyst active materials (Au catalyst), resulting in the enhancement of gas sensing properties. This study is the first to perform a comparison of SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures. SnO2 NWs are prepared through two different thermal evaporation processes, with one process for core NWs and another for outer secondary NWs. The two-step thermal evaporation process is used to synthesize hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures while excluding the gold catalyst to eliminate any effect it may have on the gas sensing properties of the fabricated hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures. The gas sensing performances of the SnO2 NWs and hierarchical nanostructures are evaluated and compared.\nThe SnO2 NWs used in this study were synthesized through two different thermal evaporation processes. In the first process, SnO2 NWs were grown at 980 \u00b0C on Si substrates that have previously been deposited with Au catalyst, using SnO powder as the source. The second process is similar to the first, except that it was carried out at 800 \u00b0C with Sn powder as the source. These two processes, when done in series, produced hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, initially synthesizing core NWs and then outer nanostructures. Samples grown by the first process were termed as sample A, by the second process as sample B, and those by the two combined processes as sample C. Both processes have been described in detail in our previous studies . In brief, the SnO2 NWs were grown in a quartz tube located in a horizontal furnace (Lingdberg/Blue M, Model: TF55030A, USA). Pure SnO powder (for growing core NWs) or Sn powder (for growing outer NWs) was placed in an alumina boat as the evaporation source. Substrates with a layer of previously deposited Au catalyst by ion sputtering were placed approximately 1.5 cm from the source. Both methods were divided into two steps. Initially, the quartz tube was evacuated to 10\u22122 Torr and purged several times with high purity Ar gas (99.999%). Subsequently, the quartz tube was evacuated to 10\u22122 Torr again, and the furnace temperature was increased from room-temperature to 980 \u00b0C or 800 \u00b0C. When the growth temperature was reached, oxygen gas (99.99%) was added to the quartz tube at a flow rate of 0.3\u20130.5 sccm, while maintaining a pressure of \u223c2\u20135 Torr inside the tube. The growth temperature was maintained for 30 min. The morphology and crystal structure of SnO2 NW and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures were investigated through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The XRD (Philips Xpert Pro) was operated with a CuK\u03b1 radiation generated at 40 kV. The PL spectra were acquired at room-temperature from 360 to 910 nm using a 325 nm He\u2013Cd laser.\nTo characterize the gas sensing properties, synthesized SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures were dispersed in ethanol and deposited on a pre-fabricated interdigitated electrode substrate using a micropipette. Numerous drops were placed on the electrode to generate a thick film of each of the samples, which can eliminate the effect of SnO2 NWs film thickness and NWs density on gas sensing performance . The sensor fabricated from the SnO2 NWs grown at 980 \u00b0C was denoted as sensor A, that from SnO2 NWs grown at 800 \u00b0C was denoted as sensor B, and that from the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures was denoted as sensor C.\nThe gas sensing properties were studied by measuring all the sensors with liquid petroleum gas (LPG, 500\u20132000 ppm) and NH3 (300\u20131000 ppm) at different temperatures (50\u2013450 \u00b0C) using a homemade set up (Fig. 1 ) with high speed switching gas flow (from/to air to/from balance gas). Balance gases (0.1% in air) were purchased from Air Liquid Group, Singapore. The system employed a flow-through with a constant rate of 200 sccm.\nFE-SEM images of SnO2 NWs, samples A and B, are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The morphologies of NWs synthesized through different techniques do not differ from each other. Structural images of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, sample C, are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The morphology of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures is distinct compared with SnO2 NWs. Core NWs appear distorted, and other NWs and nanobelts (NBs) seem to branch from them. Results are completely different from a previous report . This can be attributed to the modified procedure, where Au nanoparticles are not reseeded during the second growth process. This is verified by the similarity of the results reported in literature and the results obtained (Fig. 2(e) and (f)), in which Au nanoparticles were deposited on the core NWs as reseeding catalysts for the outer NWs growth. The growth mechanism of SnO2 core NWs with Au nanoparticles as catalysts had initially been elucidated by Wagner and Ellis based on the vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) process, followed by many researchers . We believe that the branched NWs/NBs were grown by a catalyst-free vapor\u2013solid (VS) process because the secondary outer NWs/NBs can be directly formed from the vapor phase in the absence of the catalyst . The following growth mechanism is proposed: some small Sn droplets from Sn vapor attach to the surface of the core NWs and form new growth sites. Once the Sn droplets completely attach to the surface of core NWs and become nucleation sites, epitaxial growth of branched NWs/NBs takes place. The branching pattern generated is not uniform because the Sn droplets were not homogeneous. Core NWs become distorted because of the oxidation of liquid Sn droplets coated the core NWs to SnO2.\nFig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the samples. All the diffraction peaks for the products match the tetragonal rutile SnO2 profile (a = 4.738 and c = 3.187) obtained from the JCPDS 77\u20130450 card. As such, nanostructures consist predominantly of pure SnO2. We have observed that the NWs density of the sample A was lower than that of sample B. This is an explanation why the peaks from sample A have lower intensity than that from sample B.\nThere are several papers in the literature that report on the luminescence spectra of SnO2 with different morphologies . It is recognized that oxygen vacancies play important roles in these luminescence bands as well as gas sensing properties. For these reasons, the room-temperature PL spectra of the SnO2 NWs from samples A, B, and C were characterized. Fig. 4 shows the room temperature PL spectra acquired from the samples. All spectra show a strong visible PL band at 620 nm, which has been consistently attributed to oxygen vacancies that are essential defects of metal oxides . Despite the morphological differences between SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures, the same PL results are obtained from these samples. The reason for this is unclear, and further studies are necessary to obtain a plausible explanation. However, the hypothesis explanation is that the oxygen vacancies and sizes of nanowires and hierarchical nanostructures may not be much different.\nTo investigate and compare the gas sensing properties of SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, sensors were tested at different temperatures ranging from 50 to 450 \u00b0C with an interval of 50 \u00b0C to optimize working temperature. Responses were measured with LPG and NH3 gas at concentrations of 2000 and 1000 ppm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 , the temperature has an obvious influence on the response of the sensors to LPG and NH3 gas. The bell-shaped distribution of response against operating temperature reveals that optimum performance is achieved at 350 and 200 \u00b0C for LPG and NH3 gas, respectively. Previous work has also reported bell-shaped sensor responses . The maximum response values to 2000 ppm LPG and 1000 ppm NH3 gas were 6, 6.2, 20.4 and 7.1, 7.9, 21.7 for sensors A, B, and C, respectively. For both gases, the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructure exhibits a response that is three times that of the SnO2 NWs sensors at the optimal operating temperatures. Responses of the two SnO2 NW sensors are very similar, mainly because their morphologies and wire diameters are alike (Fig. 2). Comparing the response of sensor C to the two gases (LPG, NH3), temperature can be used to selectively detect NH3. For instance, at 200 \u00b0C, the response of sensor C to 1000 ppm NH3 is about 21.7, whereas its response to 2000 ppm LPG is about 2.5.\nAfter the optimized temperature was determined, response patterns to different gas concentrations were investigated. The three sensors were tested at 350 \u00b0C with LPG concentrations of 500, 1000, and 2000 ppm. Fig. 6(a)\u2013(c) shows the dynamic response-recovery curves of sensors A, B, and C to LPG, respectively. The response amplitudes of all the sensors increase with increasing gas concentration [Fig. 6(d)]. As expected, compared with SnO2 NW sensors, the sensor based on hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures (sensor C) exhibits enhanced responses for each concentration. Fig. 7 presents the results of testing the sensors at 200 \u00b0C with NH3 concentrations of 300, 400, 500, 750 and 1000 ppm. It can be seen that hierarchical nanostructures sensor has a higher response to NH3 gas. This can be implied that the enhanced gas sensing response of the hierarchical nanostructures is relevant to other gases.\nIt has been demonstrated that the response (S = R a/R g) of oxide semiconductors is usually depicted as : S\u223c\u03b2[C]\u03b1 where \u03b2 denotes a constant, and [C] means the concentration of the target gas. In practical, the \u03b1 is in range from 1/2 to 1, dependent on the charge of the surface species, the stoichiometry of the elementary reactions on the surface and measurement range of the target gas. For the case of one-dimensional nanostructure SnO2, which has a good response to various gases, the \u03b1 value can be around 1 . In our case, we have also found that the sensor response to LPG and NH3 seem to be shown a linear relationship with gas concentration in the measured range (see Figs. 6(d) and 7(d)).\nWe have measured the sensor response with relative large number of gas pulse sequence and did not find out any change in the sensor response and the base-resistance of the sensor (data not shown). This can imply that the performance of the hierarchical nanostructure sensors has good repeatability and the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures materials are promising candidates for gas sensing applications. We have made comparison LPG and NH3 response of our SnO2 NWs and SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures sensors as presented in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. It can be seen that the responses of SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures to LPG and NH3 are comparable with reported values . However, SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures have not yet optimized for practical application. The sensor performance can be improved further by functionalization with active catalysts nanoparticles for detection of LPG and NH3 gas.\nThe mechanism of enhanced gas sensing performance of hierarchical nanostructures is still unclear. Q. Wan et al. reported that branched SnO2 NW sensors have higher responses to ethanol than general SnO2 NW sensors . However, we believe that the Au catalyst previously deposited in the second growth step of SnO2 branches may have had a role in enhancing the gas sensing performance. This is likely the case with SnO2 NWs functionalized with nanoparticle catalysts . Recently, the gas sensing performance of ZnO NWs and hierarchical ZnO nanostructures were compared, and the gas response enhancement of the latter was established and explained . Since the gas sensing mechanisms of ZnO and SnO2 nanostructures are very similar, enhancement of the gas sensing performance of SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures can be attributed to (i) higher porosity, (ii) more active centers obtained from enhanced oxygen vacancy defects, and (iii) junctions of the core and outer NWs/NBs. To clearly understand the enhancement of gas sensing properties of the hierarchical nanostructures, we first explain the gas sensing mechanism of SnO2 NWs sensors. As depicted in Fig. 8 , when SnO2 NWs is exposed in air, oxygen molecules will adsorb on the surface and capture electrons from the conductance band of the NWs to become oxygen ions (active surface complexes). The adsorbed oxygen ions on the SnO2 NWs act as electron acceptors that generate a surface depletion region on the surface of the NWs. The width of the depletion region is sensitive to the ambient gases. As exposed to LPG and NH3 gas (donated electrons molecules), the reactions between these molecules and the active chemical complexes (oxygen ions) on the surface will lead to the release of the trapped electrons, resulting in a decrease of the depletion width. This leads to a decrease of the resistance of along the longitudinal SnO2 NWs. However, our SnO2 NWs sensors are a network type and there are many NWs bridge between the two Pt electrodes forming many networking points of SnO2\u2013SnO2 NWs (see Fig. 8(a)). The potential barrier around the networking points are blocked the electrons flow in a more efficient way compared with the depletion region on the surface. Because the barriers, with adjustable thickness and height, control the transport of electrons between the NWs through the equation : R=R0expe\u0394VbkbT\nIn this equation, \u0394V b is the change of the barrier potential defined as the potential in air minus that in target gas, R 0 is a factor including the resistance in air and other parameters, e is the charge of an electron, k b is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature. When the sensors are exposed to LPG and NH3, not only the depletion width on the surface of the NWs, but also the height of the barrier potential at the networking point contact will decrease. From the schematic illustration of gas sensing mechanism of SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), we can clearly see that the hierarchical nanostructures have a higher porosity and more active sites compared to the SnO2 WNs sensor. More importantly, the hierarchical nanostructures sensor has much higher network point contacts (see Fig. 8(b)). This can be dominant factor in enhancing the gas sensing properties of the hierarchical nanostructures.\nFor practical applications, the response and recovery times of the gas sensors are very important concerns. Fig. 9 (a) and (b) shows the plots of the dynamic resistance responses of the three sensors to 1000 ppm LPG and 300 ppm NH3 gas, respectively. The 90% response time for gas exposure [t 90%(air-to-gas)] and that for recovery [t 90%(gas-to-air)] were calculated from the resistance-time data shown in Fig. 9. The t 90%(air-to-gas) values for LPG and NH3 gas are around 4 and 17 s, respectively, whereas the t 90%(gas-to-air) values for LPG and NH3 gas are around 9 and 30 s, respectively. For each of the gases, response and recovery times do not differ greatly from each other. These tests were performed at the corresponding optimal temperatures of the sensors, which may have contributed to the differences in values between the different gases.\nThis study demonstrated the use of a two-step thermal evaporation method in synthesizing hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures for gas sensing applications. Gas sensors fabricated from SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures were used to study and compare the gas sensing performance of the different nanostructures. Comparative gas sensing tests showed that hierarchical nanostructures exhibit enhanced gas sensing performance, which may be attributed to high porosity, more active sites, and addition of core\u2013outer junctions to the materials. Thus, synthesized hierarchically porous SnO2 nanostructures have a great potential for gas sensor applications, in addition to being used as photocatalysts and anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, this work provides a simple and controllable approach that can be extended to the synthesis of other hierarchical nanotructures based on metal oxide materials, such as SnO2, In2O3, ZnO, WO3, and TiO2.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Development of methods for the controlled fabrication of nanostructures is currently the greatest challenge in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Recently, much attention has been directed to the use of low dimensional nanostructures such as nanoparticles, nanowires (NWs), and nanotubes, as building blocks in the production of hierarchical nanostructures because of various novel applications. Lieber and colleagues developed a technique for a large-scale hierarchical organization of NWs arrays for integrated nanosystems , whereas Wang and colleagues reported that novel hierarchical nanostructures based on NWs can be used as solar-cells and nanogenerators . Due to characteristic high porosity of hierarchical nanostructures, they also have been studied as photocatalysts and gas sensors . Gas sensing properties of hierarchical nanostructures from metal oxides have been comprehensively reviewed by Lee . To date, the synthesis of hierarchical nanostructures from metal oxides can be classified into three categories. The first method involves high thermal evaporation of precursor powders accompanied by a low-temperature condensation. One-step and multi-steps of the thermal evaporation processes have been employed in the synthesis of different hierarchical nanostructures such as ZnO\u2013ZnO , ZnO\u2013SnO2 , SnO2\u2013SnO2 , and ZnO\u2013In2O3 , and WO3 . The second technique is a wet-chemical route, which is simple, environmentally friendly, operated low-temperatures, inexpensive, and products high-throughput . The third option is a combination of the first two methods . It can be recognized that the hierarchization strategy consists of two-step vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) growths are frequently used because the hierarchical NWs can be precisely controlled through the thermal evaporation steps. The first step is to grow the core NWs and the second step is to grow the outer NWs by reseeding of nanoparticle catalysts on the core NWs surface.\nPrevious studies have reported that hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures are relatively good gas sensors . More or less, the gas sensing properties of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures prepared by a two-step thermal evaporation process can be enhanced by the deposition of the gold nanoparticles in the core NWs before the second step of the thermal evaporation process. This is likely the materials are functionalized with catalyst active materials (Au catalyst), resulting in the enhancement of gas sensing properties. This study is the first to perform a comparison of SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures. SnO2 NWs are prepared through two different thermal evaporation processes, with one process for core NWs and another for outer secondary NWs. The two-step thermal evaporation process is used to synthesize hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures while excluding the gold catalyst to eliminate any effect it may have on the gas sensing properties of the fabricated hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures. The gas sensing performances of the SnO2 NWs and hierarchical nanostructures are evaluated and compared.\nThe SnO2 NWs used in this study were synthesized through two different thermal evaporation processes. In the first process, SnO2 NWs were grown at 980 \u00b0C on Si substrates that have previously been deposited with Au catalyst, using SnO powder as the source. The second process is similar to the first, except that it was carried out at 800 \u00b0C with Sn powder as the source. These two processes, when done in series, produced hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, initially synthesizing core NWs and then outer nanostructures. Samples grown by the first process were termed as sample A, by the second process as sample B, and those by the two combined processes as sample C. Both processes have been described in detail in our previous studies . In brief, the SnO2 NWs were grown in a quartz tube located in a horizontal furnace (Lingdberg/Blue M, Model: TF55030A, USA). Pure SnO powder (for growing core NWs) or Sn powder (for growing outer NWs) was placed in an alumina boat as the evaporation source. Substrates with a layer of previously deposited Au catalyst by ion sputtering were placed approximately 1.5 cm from the source. Both methods were divided into two steps. Initially, the quartz tube was evacuated to 10\u22122 Torr and purged several times with high purity Ar gas (99.999%). Subsequently, the quartz tube was evacuated to 10\u22122 Torr again, and the furnace temperature was increased from room-temperature to 980 \u00b0C or 800 \u00b0C. When the growth temperature was reached, oxygen gas (99.99%) was added to the quartz tube at a flow rate of 0.3\u20130.5 sccm, while maintaining a pressure of \u223c2\u20135 Torr inside the tube. The growth temperature was maintained for 30 min. The morphology and crystal structure of SnO2 NW and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures were investigated through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). The XRD (Philips Xpert Pro) was operated with a CuK\u03b1 radiation generated at 40 kV. The PL spectra were acquired at room-temperature from 360 to 910 nm using a 325 nm He\u2013Cd laser.\nTo characterize the gas sensing properties, synthesized SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures were dispersed in ethanol and deposited on a pre-fabricated interdigitated electrode substrate using a micropipette. Numerous drops were placed on the electrode to generate a thick film of each of the samples, which can eliminate the effect of SnO2 NWs film thickness and NWs density on gas sensing performance . The sensor fabricated from the SnO2 NWs grown at 980 \u00b0C was denoted as sensor A, that from SnO2 NWs grown at 800 \u00b0C was denoted as sensor B, and that from the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures was denoted as sensor C.\nThe gas sensing properties were studied by measuring all the sensors with liquid petroleum gas (LPG, 500\u20132000 ppm) and NH3 (300\u20131000 ppm) at different temperatures (50\u2013450 \u00b0C) using a homemade set up (Fig. 1 ) with high speed switching gas flow (from/to air to/from balance gas). Balance gases (0.1% in air) were purchased from Air Liquid Group, Singapore. The system employed a flow-through with a constant rate of 200 sccm.\nFE-SEM images of SnO2 NWs, samples A and B, are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The morphologies of NWs synthesized through different techniques do not differ from each other. Structural images of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, sample C, are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The morphology of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures is distinct compared with SnO2 NWs. Core NWs appear distorted, and other NWs and nanobelts (NBs) seem to branch from them. Results are completely different from a previous report . This can be attributed to the modified procedure, where Au nanoparticles are not reseeded during the second growth process. This is verified by the similarity of the results reported in literature and the results obtained (Fig. 2(e) and (f)), in which Au nanoparticles were deposited on the core NWs as reseeding catalysts for the outer NWs growth. The growth mechanism of SnO2 core NWs with Au nanoparticles as catalysts had initially been elucidated by Wagner and Ellis based on the vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) process, followed by many researchers . We believe that the branched NWs/NBs were grown by a catalyst-free vapor\u2013solid (VS) process because the secondary outer NWs/NBs can be directly formed from the vapor phase in the absence of the catalyst . The following growth mechanism is proposed: some small Sn droplets from Sn vapor attach to the surface of the core NWs and form new growth sites. Once the Sn droplets completely attach to the surface of core NWs and become nucleation sites, epitaxial growth of branched NWs/NBs takes place. The branching pattern generated is not uniform because the Sn droplets were not homogeneous. Core NWs become distorted because of the oxidation of liquid Sn droplets coated the core NWs to SnO2.\nFig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the samples. All the diffraction peaks for the products match the tetragonal rutile SnO2 profile (a = 4.738 and c = 3.187) obtained from the JCPDS 77\u20130450 card. As such, nanostructures consist predominantly of pure SnO2. We have observed that the NWs density of the sample A was lower than that of sample B. This is an explanation why the peaks from sample A have lower intensity than that from sample B.\nThere are several papers in the literature that report on the luminescence spectra of SnO2 with different morphologies . It is recognized that oxygen vacancies play important roles in these luminescence bands as well as gas sensing properties. For these reasons, the room-temperature PL spectra of the SnO2 NWs from samples A, B, and C were characterized. Fig. 4 shows the room temperature PL spectra acquired from the samples. All spectra show a strong visible PL band at 620 nm, which has been consistently attributed to oxygen vacancies that are essential defects of metal oxides . Despite the morphological differences between SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures, the same PL results are obtained from these samples. The reason for this is unclear, and further studies are necessary to obtain a plausible explanation. However, the hypothesis explanation is that the oxygen vacancies and sizes of nanowires and hierarchical nanostructures may not be much different.\nTo investigate and compare the gas sensing properties of SnO2 NWs and hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures, sensors were tested at different temperatures ranging from 50 to 450 \u00b0C with an interval of 50 \u00b0C to optimize working temperature. Responses were measured with LPG and NH3 gas at concentrations of 2000 and 1000 ppm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 , the temperature has an obvious influence on the response of the sensors to LPG and NH3 gas. The bell-shaped distribution of response against operating temperature reveals that optimum performance is achieved at 350 and 200 \u00b0C for LPG and NH3 gas, respectively. Previous work has also reported bell-shaped sensor responses . The maximum response values to 2000 ppm LPG and 1000 ppm NH3 gas were 6, 6.2, 20.4 and 7.1, 7.9, 21.7 for sensors A, B, and C, respectively. For both gases, the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructure exhibits a response that is three times that of the SnO2 NWs sensors at the optimal operating temperatures. Responses of the two SnO2 NW sensors are very similar, mainly because their morphologies and wire diameters are alike (Fig. 2). Comparing the response of sensor C to the two gases (LPG, NH3), temperature can be used to selectively detect NH3. For instance, at 200 \u00b0C, the response of sensor C to 1000 ppm NH3 is about 21.7, whereas its response to 2000 ppm LPG is about 2.5.\nAfter the optimized temperature was determined, response patterns to different gas concentrations were investigated. The three sensors were tested at 350 \u00b0C with LPG concentrations of 500, 1000, and 2000 ppm. Fig. 6(a)\u2013(c) shows the dynamic response-recovery curves of sensors A, B, and C to LPG, respectively. The response amplitudes of all the sensors increase with increasing gas concentration [Fig. 6(d)]. As expected, compared with SnO2 NW sensors, the sensor based on hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures (sensor C) exhibits enhanced responses for each concentration. Fig. 7 presents the results of testing the sensors at 200 \u00b0C with NH3 concentrations of 300, 400, 500, 750 and 1000 ppm. It can be seen that hierarchical nanostructures sensor has a higher response to NH3 gas. This can be implied that the enhanced gas sensing response of the hierarchical nanostructures is relevant to other gases.\nIt has been demonstrated that the response (S = R a/R g) of oxide semiconductors is usually depicted as : S\u223c\u03b2[C]\u03b1 where \u03b2 denotes a constant, and [C] means the concentration of the target gas. In practical, the \u03b1 is in range from 1/2 to 1, dependent on the charge of the surface species, the stoichiometry of the elementary reactions on the surface and measurement range of the target gas. For the case of one-dimensional nanostructure SnO2, which has a good response to various gases, the \u03b1 value can be around 1 . In our case, we have also found that the sensor response to LPG and NH3 seem to be shown a linear relationship with gas concentration in the measured range (see Figs. 6(d) and 7(d)).\nWe have measured the sensor response with relative large number of gas pulse sequence and did not find out any change in the sensor response and the base-resistance of the sensor (data not shown). This can imply that the performance of the hierarchical nanostructure sensors has good repeatability and the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures materials are promising candidates for gas sensing applications. We have made comparison LPG and NH3 response of our SnO2 NWs and SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures sensors as presented in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. It can be seen that the responses of SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures to LPG and NH3 are comparable with reported values . However, SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures have not yet optimized for practical application. The sensor performance can be improved further by functionalization with active catalysts nanoparticles for detection of LPG and NH3 gas.\nThe mechanism of enhanced gas sensing performance of hierarchical nanostructures is still unclear. Q. Wan et al. reported that branched SnO2 NW sensors have higher responses to ethanol than general SnO2 NW sensors . However, we believe that the Au catalyst previously deposited in the second growth step of SnO2 branches may have had a role in enhancing the gas sensing performance. This is likely the case with SnO2 NWs functionalized with nanoparticle catalysts . Recently, the gas sensing performance of ZnO NWs and hierarchical ZnO nanostructures were compared, and the gas response enhancement of the latter was established and explained . Since the gas sensing mechanisms of ZnO and SnO2 nanostructures are very similar, enhancement of the gas sensing performance of SnO2 hierarchical nanostructures can be attributed to (i) higher porosity, (ii) more active centers obtained from enhanced oxygen vacancy defects, and (iii) junctions of the core and outer NWs/NBs. To clearly understand the enhancement of gas sensing properties of the hierarchical nanostructures, we first explain the gas sensing mechanism of SnO2 NWs sensors. As depicted in Fig. 8 , when SnO2 NWs is exposed in air, oxygen molecules will adsorb on the surface and capture electrons from the conductance band of the NWs to become oxygen ions (active surface complexes). The adsorbed oxygen ions on the SnO2 NWs act as electron acceptors that generate a surface depletion region on the surface of the NWs. The width of the depletion region is sensitive to the ambient gases. As exposed to LPG and NH3 gas (donated electrons molecules), the reactions between these molecules and the active chemical complexes (oxygen ions) on the surface will lead to the release of the trapped electrons, resulting in a decrease of the depletion width. This leads to a decrease of the resistance of along the longitudinal SnO2 NWs. However, our SnO2 NWs sensors are a network type and there are many NWs bridge between the two Pt electrodes forming many networking points of SnO2\u2013SnO2 NWs (see Fig. 8(a)). The potential barrier around the networking points are blocked the electrons flow in a more efficient way compared with the depletion region on the surface. Because the barriers, with adjustable thickness and height, control the transport of electrons between the NWs through the equation : R=R0expe\u0394VbkbT\nIn this equation, \u0394V b is the change of the barrier potential defined as the potential in air minus that in target gas, R 0 is a factor including the resistance in air and other parameters, e is the charge of an electron, k b is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature. When the sensors are exposed to LPG and NH3, not only the depletion width on the surface of the NWs, but also the height of the barrier potential at the networking point contact will decrease. From the schematic illustration of gas sensing mechanism of SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), we can clearly see that the hierarchical nanostructures have a higher porosity and more active sites compared to the SnO2 WNs sensor. More importantly, the hierarchical nanostructures sensor has much higher network point contacts (see Fig. 8(b)). This can be dominant factor in enhancing the gas sensing properties of the hierarchical nanostructures.\nFor practical applications, the response and recovery times of the gas sensors are very important concerns. Fig. 9 (a) and (b) shows the plots of the dynamic resistance responses of the three sensors to 1000 ppm LPG and 300 ppm NH3 gas, respectively. The 90% response time for gas exposure [t 90%(air-to-gas)] and that for recovery [t 90%(gas-to-air)] were calculated from the resistance-time data shown in Fig. 9. The t 90%(air-to-gas) values for LPG and NH3 gas are around 4 and 17 s, respectively, whereas the t 90%(gas-to-air) values for LPG and NH3 gas are around 9 and 30 s, respectively. For each of the gases, response and recovery times do not differ greatly from each other. These tests were performed at the corresponding optimal temperatures of the sensors, which may have contributed to the differences in values between the different gases.\nThis study demonstrated the use of a two-step thermal evaporation method in synthesizing hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures for gas sensing applications. Gas sensors fabricated from SnO2 NWs and their hierarchical nanostructures were used to study and compare the gas sensing performance of the different nanostructures. Comparative gas sensing tests showed that hierarchical nanostructures exhibit enhanced gas sensing performance, which may be attributed to high porosity, more active sites, and addition of core\u2013outer junctions to the materials. Thus, synthesized hierarchically porous SnO2 nanostructures have a great potential for gas sensor applications, in addition to being used as photocatalysts and anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, this work provides a simple and controllable approach that can be extended to the synthesis of other hierarchical nanotructures based on metal oxide materials, such as SnO2, In2O3, ZnO, WO3, and TiO2."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nIn the pharmaceutical industry the early identification of toxicological side-effects of potential new drug candidates is of fundamental value in the minimisation of compound \u201cattrition\u201d . While specific assays have been developed to detect abnormal changes in biofluids of test animals, histopathological tissue examination remains the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 in toxicological assessment. Since investigating toxicity by traditional techniques is time consuming and costly, different approaches to the reliable and effective prediction of toxicity have been explored. Currently, there are several advanced technologies using multiparametric biochemical information derived from different levels of biomolecular organisation. Genomic and proteomic information describing transcriptional effects and protein synthesis can be extracted . However, these approaches are also slow and expensive. Alternatively, the metabonomic approach analyses the entire pool of endogenous metabolites in a biofluid or tissue, and is a powerful technique for detecting and describing biological endpoint-effects. It has already proven to be effective in the description of genetic strain differences, disease states, nutritional effects and toxic influences . In this study, we report the initial evaluation of metabonomic data yielded in a large-scale toxicological project within the COnsortium for MEtabonomic Toxicology (COMET). The COMET 1 project is currently constructing databases and metabolic models of drug toxicity using ca. 100,000 1H NMR spectra of biofluids from rats and mice treated with approximately 150 model compounds. Multivariate statistical models characterising the effects of toxins on endogenous metabolite profiles have been generated and will be used for the development of computer-based expert systems. These will enable rapid pre-clinical toxicological screening of potential drug candidates.\nAs a prototype for such large and comprehensive databases we have used a subset of the data to study dose- and time-related effects, to develop and evaluate classification methods and explore characteristic features of toxicity (the \u2018biomarker profile\u2019). This facilitates the prediction and interpretation of large-scale data sets and will help to hone the development of new analytical tools. We describe a first attempt to explore and predict the effect of different toxins, surgical procedures and other external influences in 19 independent studies using 1H NMR-metabonomic analysis of rat urine samples. Urine samples were collected from dosed and control rats at 10 time points over a period of 8 days and were subsequently analysed by 600 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied to the data from the studies to reveal dose and time-related effects in the response of animals to different toxins. Finally, k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) classification was used to predict how well individual samples were classified into their respective class and time point. This work gives an insight into the scope of this project and illustrates the diagnostic power and reliability of metabonomic data analysis using 1H NMR spectroscopy together with chemometric techniques for the exploration and prediction of toxic effects.\nIn established in-house or external animal research facilities of the involved pharmaceutical companies, male 8\u201310 week old Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in metabolism cages and urine samples collected daily. Free access to food and water was permitted throughout the studies (except in the case of food and water restriction studies). The animals were randomly assigned to three dose groups: control (vehicle only, n=10), high-dose (dose causing a clear toxic effect, n=10) and low-dose (sub-toxic dose, n=10). For those studies without drug-treatment, classes were distinguished as follows: partial hepatectomy (L9), unilateral nephrectomy (K5), food restriction (O5): (1) 25%, (2) 50%, (3) 100% (for 1 day); 48 h water deprivation (O4).\nIn general, the animals were dosed or underwent surgery at 0 h. Urine samples were collected at \u221216 h (predose) (n=10) and 0 h (n=10), 8 h (n=10), 24 h (n=10), 48 h (n=10), 72 h (n=5), 96 h (n=5), 120 h (n=5), 144 h (n=5) and 168 h (n=5) postdose (p.d.) and stored at \u221240 \u00b0C. Half of the animals was euthanised at 48 h p.d., the other half at 168 h p.d. and organ tissue samples (liver (L), kidney (K) and in a small number of cases the pancreas) were submitted for histopathological examination (Table 1 ).\n1H NMR spectroscopy was carried out using an AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Analytische GmbH, Faellanden, Switzerland). Aliquots of each urine sample (400 \u03bcl) were added to 200 \u03bcl of sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M Na2HPO4 in H2O and 0.2 M NaH2PO4 in 80:20 H2O:D2O, pH 7.4) containing 1 mM sodium trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate (TSP) and 3 mM sodium azide. Samples were centrifuged at \u223c1800 \u00d7 g for 5 min to remove any solid debris. 1H NMR spectra were measured at 300 K using a flow-injection system (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany). NMR acquisition was performed using the first increment of a NOESY sequence with irradiation of the water frequence during the mixing time and relaxation delay. This resulted in a total acquisition time of \u223c4 min per sample.\nSpectra were automatically phase- and baseline-corrected and referenced to the chemical shift of TSP (\u03b4 = 0.0) using a Matlab routine (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts) written in-house. Each NMR spectrum was reduced to 205 integrated regions of equal width (0.04 ppm) corresponding to the region \u03b4 = 0.2\u201310.0, excluding the region surrounding the water signal from \u03b4 = 4.50\u20135.98. All spectra were normalised to a constant integrated intensity of 100 units.\nExcretion of drug-related compounds into the urine can contribute to additional large signals in the 1H NMR spectra. These distort the scaling of spectra and give false classification results (as they are compound-related, not endogenous and show clear time- and dose-related concentration changes). In order to minimize the effect of drug-related signals in our study set of NMR spectra, the affected areas were treated according to a standard procedure as detailed in .\nMetabonomic changes in the urine samples were seen in the high-dose experiments and in some of the low-dose studies. For this first evaluation, only high-dose samples, where toxicity was confirmed by histopathology, and control samples (including predose samples) were compared.\nFour classification tasks were undertaken using the metabonomic sample data:\nClassification of samples according to organ-site specificity (liver, kidney or controls (C)).\nPrediction of organ-site specificity for a four-class system (liver, kidney, a further group comprising other (O) effects, or controls).\nPrediction of all samples into the individual studies.\nPrediction of the samples into their individual time points.\nFor most of the toxicological studies time points could be identified where the metabonomic urine profile changes significantly compared to controls. In order to classify the different studies, the selection of time points is vital. Studies can be either compared at the time point of maximum effect or at all time points showing an effect distinct from the control samples (Fig. 1 ). Both ways of characterising the study-specific differences were applied. In many of the studies a maximum effect could be observed at 48 h postdose (Table 1). Therefore, one particular comparison was carried out using the 48 h samples only.\nPrincipal component analysis and partial-least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used in order to visualise the complex multivariate dataspace. Scores plots facilitated visualisation of the study-specific clustering of samples, while loadings plots revealed the characteristic underlying metabolic changes by showing the influence of the different spectral areas on the principal components (PCs). PCA and PLS-DA were performed using SIMCA-P 9.0 (Umetrics AB, Ume\u00e5, Sweden).\nHCA was applied to the data in order to detect intra- and inter-study similarities. In the individual studies, the spectral data at each time point significantly different from controls were averaged across animals and used for subsequent analysis. Centroidal linkage was chosen as the optimum linkage method, because it is less susceptible to effects of outliers and reduces problems due to overlap of clusters. HCA was performed using Pirouette 2.70 (Infometrix Inc., Woodinville, USA).\nClassification was accomplished using the kNN approach. Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was applied to obtain a first impression of the classification results. However, for \u201creal-life\u201d applications a classification with a training and test-set is more realistic. Therefore, a training and a test-set with approximately the same number of samples in each set (50:50) was built and prediction of those test data in the training data space was carried out. Subsequently, the training and test-set were exchanged and classification was repeated. The results from both runs were averaged. Error estimates were obtained from half the difference between the two results. The optimum neighbourhood parameters k were determined by repeating classification runs with different values of k. Those predictions with the lowest number of misclassifications gave the optimum neighbourhood parameter. kNN classification was performed using Pirouette 2.70 (Infometrix Inc., Woodinville, USA).\nThe complete dataset containing controls and samples taken at time points of significant metabonomic effect amounted to 2844 samples (2203 controls and predose samples, 641 samples postdose). As the controls were overweighted, 9 out of 10 control samples were randomly excluded, resulting in a dataset comprising 210 control urine samples, 328 samples from rats administered with a liver toxin, 145 samples from kidney toxin-treated rats and 168 samples from animals treated with other toxins or manipulations. Reduction of the data to include 48 h time points only resulted in 50 controls and 87, 50 and 60 urine samples after liver, kidney or other treatments, respectively.\nPCA of the averaged spectra at each time point gave a clear overview of the treatment- and time-related metabonomic effects as observed by NMR spectroscopy of the urine (Fig. 2 ). Separation of these data points can be attributed to alterations in NMR signals of endogenous urinary metabolites as seen in the loadings plot. Urines from streptozotocin-treated animals revealed a urinary metabolic profile distinct from all other treatment groups, mainly due to elevated glucose signals (\u03b4 = 3.4\u20133.88). Furthermore, the treatment with kidney toxins HCBD (K2) and mercury chloride (K4) resulted in common metabonomic effects, which were expected because both toxins cause tubular necrosis. Treatments resulting in a periportal liver lesion, such as the two groups of hydrazine-treated rats (L1, L2), are described by an increase in the scores for PC3 (due to an increase in e.g. taurine at \u03b4 = 3.28 and 2-aminoadipic acid at \u03b4 = 2.24, 1.64). Partial hepatectomy (L9), where entire liver lobes were removed, showed a similar increase in PC3, but still this group could be differentiated from L1 and L2. Other liver toxin groups, such as ANIT (L3, biliary, necrosis) and BHT (L5, centrilobular necrosis), showed opposite metabolic effects resulting in a decrease in PC3, and were well separated from hydrazine-induced liver toxicity.\nFig. 3 shows the best separation between controls (C), liver (L) and kidney (K) toxins using PLS-DA. It reveals that some samples from the kidney treatment group (K1, K3, K5) overlapped with samples from the liver treatment group. This most likely led to some misclassifications in the subsequent kNN classification runs. Many of the urines from the liver group clustered together and only L1 and L2 were significantly separated from the bulk of liver toxins. Late time points from studies L5 (BHT) and L9 (partial hepatectomy) overlapped with the control samples, suggesting that major effects in these studies were seen at early time points and that the urinary excretion profile at these later time points had returned close to normal. Finally, L1, L2 and K2, K4 showed the best separation between liver and kidney toxins as well as from control samples.\nHierarchical cluster analysis of the averaged spectra at each time point identified four main clusters (at a similarity level of approximately 0.7) (Fig. 4 ). Three of these clusters were composed of those studies showing the largest metabonomic effects: streptozotocin (O2) in one cluster, HCBD (K2) and mercury chloride (K4) in the second, and the two hydrazine studies (L1, L2) in the third cluster. This separation agreed well with the principal component analysis results.\nThe remaining cluster was separated into four distinct subgroups. The first subgroup contained samples from liver (L3, L5, L7) and kidney (K1, K3) dose groups. This especially highlights the aspect that some of the samples from the kidney toxin studies showed borderline-character between the classes liver and kidney, which was confirmed by the PLS-DA of control, liver and kidney samples (Fig. 3). One example is adriamycin (K1) which was assigned to the group of kidney toxins prior to analysis due to its predominant kidney toxicity, although slight histopathological liver effects were observed (decreased glycogen content). 2-Chloroethanamine (K3) was also found to show slight signs of liver toxicity (hepatitis, vacuolar degeneration and decreased glycogen). These findings indicate that the metabonomic analysis of urinary NMR data is sensitive to identifying toxin group similarities without detailed a priori knowledge of the histopathological characterisation. The second subgroup consisted entirely of samples from partially hepatectomised rats and indicated that although these samples showed some comparable effects to those of the hydrazine treatment group (Fig. 2), differences between the two were visible by HCA. The third sub-cluster consisted of predominantly liver treatment groups and two other studies (O3: chloroform, O5: food restriction). Chloroform induces both liver and kidney toxicity, while the food restriction study is likely to effect liver metabolism by glycogenolysis. The fourth subgroup was made up of mainly controls and control-like samples, e.g. late time points from treatment studies (K5, L5, L9). This emphasises the difference in time-response of animals to different toxins, i.e. onset and recovery. Those samples taken at a late time point from a study with an early recovery were more likely to show an excretion profile similar to control samples. Clustering of insulin (O1) into this subgroup indicates that the variance in the control cluster is larger than the subtle effects observed in the 8 h samples from insulin dosed animals. Overall, the analysis gives an asymmetric clustering structure with a strong tail. We attribute this appearance to the fact that many time points from several studies show a small effect, whereas fewer time points show stronger effects. For example, the first three clusters (studies O2, K2 & K4, L1 & L2) comprising 23 time points show the most prominent changes. Conversely, the fourth cluster, containing studies with weaker effects, is composed of 80 time points. This leads to \u2018overweighting\u2019 towards studies with smaller effects or even samples with high similarity to controls (mostly later time points in studies).\nHCA as an unsupervised technique not only identified clear organ-toxicity specific differences but also showed similarities between samples. The overlap between treatment groups helped to explain the misclassifications in the subsequent kNN analysis.\nThe most important goal in in vivo toxicity assessment is the determination of whether a drug is toxic, and subsequently which organ is affected. PCA, PLS-DA and especially HCA gave an impression of how well the different groups, defined by target organ, may be separated. Using the samples from the 19 studies taken at 48 h p.d., where the time point of maximum metabonomic effect was apparent in many of the studies, the classification into the three classes controls, liver and kidney resulted in greater than 85% correct prediction of the true class (Table 2 ) in LOO cross-validation using kNN. The best classification was achieved for the controls and liver treatment groups. Introducing a fourth class (other) led to a slight drop in correct classification of the control and liver group suggesting some misclassification into the other group. A total of 85% of the other group itself was predicted into the true class. As expected, it was more likely for those studies where the major metabonomic effect was seen at a different time point than 48 h to be misclassified as controls. This was true for the unilateral nephrectomy (K5) and the insulin treatment (O1) groups where major effects were only observed in the 8 h samples. Further reasons for misclassification were revealed in the HCA analysis, where studies from the other group (O3, O5) had close similarities to the liver group. In general, the use of training\u2013test-set (50:50) classification resulted in a slight reduction of 2\u20138% in the number of correct classification results compared to leave-one-out cross-validation, but provided a more robust model.\nThe importance of using the whole time-related urinary profile becomes obvious from the classification results obtained using all time points significantly different from controls (Table 3 ). Here, the classification of the samples resulted in a more even prediction success across the three groups (controls, liver, and kidney). LOO cross-validation resulted in greater than 90% true-class prediction. After introducing the other class, the correct prediction of the different classes in LOO cross-validation varied between 88 and 95% (training\u2013test-set classification: 85\u201391%).\nWith the exception of the liver group, all other classes showed an improvement from the use of more than one time point. The other group benefited from including the 8 h time point as this was important for the insulin study. In addition, the correct prediction of samples belonging to the kidney class increased due to the inclusion of the 8 h time point in study K5 (unilateral nephrectomy). Liver organ prediction was reduced (Table 4 ) due to the similarity of some of the late time points with control samples (L5, L9, see Fig. 4).\nIn general, our results for the organ-specific prediction suggest that the heterogeneity within the organ groups due to suborgan specific effects and different mechanisms of toxicity causes overlap between the groups. This will be taken into account while constructing larger databases. The use of a specific control model will ease the identification of important time points in the studies showing an effect compared to controls.\nTo investigate the next level of structure within the data, classifications were performed using each single toxicological study and the control samples as an individual class. Here, the study-by-study prediction employing all time points significantly different from controls (Table 5 ) was able to predict correctly the true class in 86% of cases using LOO cross-validation (81% for training\u2013test-set classification). Although the datasets analysed here have not been used to explore suborgan toxicity or toxic mechanisms specifically, the fact that each study can be clearly predicted as a separate class strongly suggests that such classification will be possible. We are currently exploring this aspect.\nAs a severe test, the division into subgroups can be pursued further so that the data is split into 87 classes where each class represents one treatment at one time point, plus one additional class for controls. With this time point-by-time point prediction (Table 5) the overall results for a correct time point prediction were between 64 and 67%, depending on the classification procedure. Fig. 5 illustrates the results from the training\u2013test-set prediction for every individual time point from the different studies. One axis shows the true class, the other axis those time points into which the samples were predicted (\u2018predicted class\u2019). The strong diagonal demonstrates that many of the samples were classified either into the correct time point of the right study, or into adjacent time points. This means that a sample which was not correctly classified into its time point was however closely predicted and mostly predicted into the right study. Reasons for misclassifications include the overlap between late time points from the treatment groups and control samples, and the similarity between the food restriction groups with 25 and 50% food reduction. As all time points from the studies together with controls amount to 88 classes, one would expect to assign a sample by chance to the correct class with a success rate of 1.1%, well below our success rates.\nSuccess of any prediction system will be determined by the selection of classes or subclasses and the number of samples in these classes. We are well aware that the ratio of samples in the different groups is an important aspect, and therefore we examined the impact of increasing the number of samples in the control group on the organ classification (48 h only). If the number of controls in our dataset was increased by approximately three-fold, the true-class prediction success for controls increased by 3% but this led to a decrease in classification success of 7% for the other group using LOO cross-validation. As this variance is due to strong overweighting, we expect our original dataset to be less affected.\nOur results show that the metabonomic approach of toxin prediction is highly competitive compared to other approaches using, e.g. genomic or proteomic information . Metabonomics has already proven useful in the description of liver and kidney toxicity using PCA and SIMCA . One application used probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) to predict toxin-affected organs in two different rat strains at an overall success rate of 94% . For each strain, samples were predicted into five classes (liver, kidney, liver & kidney, mitochondrial toxins and controls). The use of more diverse classes, such as multiple-organ toxicity (liver & kidney), should lead to improved classification results, however, kidney toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats was correctly predicted with 7% lower success rate using PNNs than with our approach using four distinct classes. Our dataset also contained a higher number of samples per class which strengthens the confidence in our results. In addition, the authors used SIMCA and multi-layer perceptrons for comparison with PNNs. However, both techniques proved to be less successful. An analytical method called CLassification Of Unknowns by Density Superposition (CLOUDS) was developed within the COMET project and is also presented in these proceedings . We have demonstrated that this non-neural technique, derived from PNNs, gave similar results within the error range compared to the robust and well-known kNN method when applied to the same data set. This emphasises the reliability of both approaches. Furthermore, CLOUDS can be tailored to complex tasks using diagnostics such as confidence and uniqueness which gives further flexibility to its use in multiparametric analysis.\nThe application of proteomic techniques as yet has played a minor role in the prediction of toxicity despite its wider use in mechanistic toxicology , however the genomic approach of using gene expression data from tissues for predicting toxicity (toxicogenomics) is becoming increasingly popular . In such studies messenger RNA information is extracted from liver tissue samples after treatment with different liver toxins. The gene expression data from 15 hepatotoxins were examined with clustering techniques revealing several similarities between different groups of the toxins and their correlation to histopathology and clinical chemistry findings . A prediction accuracy of 92% for the prediction of two toxin classes (enzyme inducers and peroxisome proliferators) was achieved using an approach with linear discriminant analysis and genetic algorithms/kNN . We have shown that the metabonomic approach can be applied to more complex classification tasks. So far, the gene expression classifications are very much focused on liver toxicity and liver subgroup-toxicity . And, although gene expression analysis has shown reasonable results in the examination of liver toxins, it is very labour-intensive requiring lengthy tissue preparation and PCR amplification and the cost of the micro-arrays is also considerable. These reasons often reduce the applicability of the technique to only single time points in the course of a toxicological study. The NMR analysis of urine samples meanwhile is easy and quick to perform which allows an immediate analysis at every important stage within the time course of a study. It is non-destructive and gives access to a variety of metabolic pathways\u2014a big advantage for high-throughput screening for drug toxicity.\nAs part of a larger effort to construct a comprehensive database of urinary metabonomic data from toxicological investigations, these preliminary results have underlined the potential of our approach for the prediction of drug toxicity. Data were employed from animal studies showing metabonomic effects due to toxin administration, surgical procedures (partial hepatectomy, unilateral nephrectomy) and other treatments (food restriction, water deprivation). It was shown that chemometric methods such as PCA, PLS-DA and HCA are important tools in the exploration and visualisation of toxicological effects in the rat. These techniques improve the understanding of the structure of metabonomic databases regarding toxin-, organ-, suborgan- and time-specificity. Within the COMET project, methods of chemometric modelling of NMR-derived, metabonomic data from animal studies are being developed for the prediction of drug toxicity. Our results, employing kNN classification suggested a good predictability of liver and kidney toxicity and other effects. More comprehensive classification based on suborgan-sites or mechanisms of toxicity is currently being explored.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "In the pharmaceutical industry the early identification of toxicological side-effects of potential new drug candidates is of fundamental value in the minimisation of compound \u201cattrition\u201d . While specific assays have been developed to detect abnormal changes in biofluids of test animals, histopathological tissue examination remains the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 in toxicological assessment. Since investigating toxicity by traditional techniques is time consuming and costly, different approaches to the reliable and effective prediction of toxicity have been explored. Currently, there are several advanced technologies using multiparametric biochemical information derived from different levels of biomolecular organisation. Genomic and proteomic information describing transcriptional effects and protein synthesis can be extracted . However, these approaches are also slow and expensive. Alternatively, the metabonomic approach analyses the entire pool of endogenous metabolites in a biofluid or tissue, and is a powerful technique for detecting and describing biological endpoint-effects. It has already proven to be effective in the description of genetic strain differences, disease states, nutritional effects and toxic influences . In this study, we report the initial evaluation of metabonomic data yielded in a large-scale toxicological project within the COnsortium for MEtabonomic Toxicology (COMET). The COMET 1 project is currently constructing databases and metabolic models of drug toxicity using ca. 100,000 1H NMR spectra of biofluids from rats and mice treated with approximately 150 model compounds. Multivariate statistical models characterising the effects of toxins on endogenous metabolite profiles have been generated and will be used for the development of computer-based expert systems. These will enable rapid pre-clinical toxicological screening of potential drug candidates.\nAs a prototype for such large and comprehensive databases we have used a subset of the data to study dose- and time-related effects, to develop and evaluate classification methods and explore characteristic features of toxicity (the \u2018biomarker profile\u2019). This facilitates the prediction and interpretation of large-scale data sets and will help to hone the development of new analytical tools. We describe a first attempt to explore and predict the effect of different toxins, surgical procedures and other external influences in 19 independent studies using 1H NMR-metabonomic analysis of rat urine samples. Urine samples were collected from dosed and control rats at 10 time points over a period of 8 days and were subsequently analysed by 600 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied to the data from the studies to reveal dose and time-related effects in the response of animals to different toxins. Finally, k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) classification was used to predict how well individual samples were classified into their respective class and time point. This work gives an insight into the scope of this project and illustrates the diagnostic power and reliability of metabonomic data analysis using 1H NMR spectroscopy together with chemometric techniques for the exploration and prediction of toxic effects.\nIn established in-house or external animal research facilities of the involved pharmaceutical companies, male 8\u201310 week old Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in metabolism cages and urine samples collected daily. Free access to food and water was permitted throughout the studies (except in the case of food and water restriction studies). The animals were randomly assigned to three dose groups: control (vehicle only, n=10), high-dose (dose causing a clear toxic effect, n=10) and low-dose (sub-toxic dose, n=10). For those studies without drug-treatment, classes were distinguished as follows: partial hepatectomy (L9), unilateral nephrectomy (K5), food restriction (O5): (1) 25%, (2) 50%, (3) 100% (for 1 day); 48 h water deprivation (O4).\nIn general, the animals were dosed or underwent surgery at 0 h. Urine samples were collected at \u221216 h (predose) (n=10) and 0 h (n=10), 8 h (n=10), 24 h (n=10), 48 h (n=10), 72 h (n=5), 96 h (n=5), 120 h (n=5), 144 h (n=5) and 168 h (n=5) postdose (p.d.) and stored at \u221240 \u00b0C. Half of the animals was euthanised at 48 h p.d., the other half at 168 h p.d. and organ tissue samples (liver (L), kidney (K) and in a small number of cases the pancreas) were submitted for histopathological examination (Table 1 ).\n1H NMR spectroscopy was carried out using an AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Analytische GmbH, Faellanden, Switzerland). Aliquots of each urine sample (400 \u03bcl) were added to 200 \u03bcl of sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M Na2HPO4 in H2O and 0.2 M NaH2PO4 in 80:20 H2O:D2O, pH 7.4) containing 1 mM sodium trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate (TSP) and 3 mM sodium azide. Samples were centrifuged at \u223c1800 \u00d7 g for 5 min to remove any solid debris. 1H NMR spectra were measured at 300 K using a flow-injection system (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany). NMR acquisition was performed using the first increment of a NOESY sequence with irradiation of the water frequence during the mixing time and relaxation delay. This resulted in a total acquisition time of \u223c4 min per sample.\nSpectra were automatically phase- and baseline-corrected and referenced to the chemical shift of TSP (\u03b4 = 0.0) using a Matlab routine (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts) written in-house. Each NMR spectrum was reduced to 205 integrated regions of equal width (0.04 ppm) corresponding to the region \u03b4 = 0.2\u201310.0, excluding the region surrounding the water signal from \u03b4 = 4.50\u20135.98. All spectra were normalised to a constant integrated intensity of 100 units.\nExcretion of drug-related compounds into the urine can contribute to additional large signals in the 1H NMR spectra. These distort the scaling of spectra and give false classification results (as they are compound-related, not endogenous and show clear time- and dose-related concentration changes). In order to minimize the effect of drug-related signals in our study set of NMR spectra, the affected areas were treated according to a standard procedure as detailed in .\nMetabonomic changes in the urine samples were seen in the high-dose experiments and in some of the low-dose studies. For this first evaluation, only high-dose samples, where toxicity was confirmed by histopathology, and control samples (including predose samples) were compared.\nFour classification tasks were undertaken using the metabonomic sample data:\nClassification of samples according to organ-site specificity (liver, kidney or controls (C)).\nPrediction of organ-site specificity for a four-class system (liver, kidney, a further group comprising other (O) effects, or controls).\nPrediction of all samples into the individual studies.\nPrediction of the samples into their individual time points.\nFor most of the toxicological studies time points could be identified where the metabonomic urine profile changes significantly compared to controls. In order to classify the different studies, the selection of time points is vital. Studies can be either compared at the time point of maximum effect or at all time points showing an effect distinct from the control samples (Fig. 1 ). Both ways of characterising the study-specific differences were applied. In many of the studies a maximum effect could be observed at 48 h postdose (Table 1). Therefore, one particular comparison was carried out using the 48 h samples only.\nPrincipal component analysis and partial-least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used in order to visualise the complex multivariate dataspace. Scores plots facilitated visualisation of the study-specific clustering of samples, while loadings plots revealed the characteristic underlying metabolic changes by showing the influence of the different spectral areas on the principal components (PCs). PCA and PLS-DA were performed using SIMCA-P 9.0 (Umetrics AB, Ume\u00e5, Sweden).\nHCA was applied to the data in order to detect intra- and inter-study similarities. In the individual studies, the spectral data at each time point significantly different from controls were averaged across animals and used for subsequent analysis. Centroidal linkage was chosen as the optimum linkage method, because it is less susceptible to effects of outliers and reduces problems due to overlap of clusters. HCA was performed using Pirouette 2.70 (Infometrix Inc., Woodinville, USA).\nClassification was accomplished using the kNN approach. Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was applied to obtain a first impression of the classification results. However, for \u201creal-life\u201d applications a classification with a training and test-set is more realistic. Therefore, a training and a test-set with approximately the same number of samples in each set (50:50) was built and prediction of those test data in the training data space was carried out. Subsequently, the training and test-set were exchanged and classification was repeated. The results from both runs were averaged. Error estimates were obtained from half the difference between the two results. The optimum neighbourhood parameters k were determined by repeating classification runs with different values of k. Those predictions with the lowest number of misclassifications gave the optimum neighbourhood parameter. kNN classification was performed using Pirouette 2.70 (Infometrix Inc., Woodinville, USA).\nThe complete dataset containing controls and samples taken at time points of significant metabonomic effect amounted to 2844 samples (2203 controls and predose samples, 641 samples postdose). As the controls were overweighted, 9 out of 10 control samples were randomly excluded, resulting in a dataset comprising 210 control urine samples, 328 samples from rats administered with a liver toxin, 145 samples from kidney toxin-treated rats and 168 samples from animals treated with other toxins or manipulations. Reduction of the data to include 48 h time points only resulted in 50 controls and 87, 50 and 60 urine samples after liver, kidney or other treatments, respectively.\nPCA of the averaged spectra at each time point gave a clear overview of the treatment- and time-related metabonomic effects as observed by NMR spectroscopy of the urine (Fig. 2 ). Separation of these data points can be attributed to alterations in NMR signals of endogenous urinary metabolites as seen in the loadings plot. Urines from streptozotocin-treated animals revealed a urinary metabolic profile distinct from all other treatment groups, mainly due to elevated glucose signals (\u03b4 = 3.4\u20133.88). Furthermore, the treatment with kidney toxins HCBD (K2) and mercury chloride (K4) resulted in common metabonomic effects, which were expected because both toxins cause tubular necrosis. Treatments resulting in a periportal liver lesion, such as the two groups of hydrazine-treated rats (L1, L2), are described by an increase in the scores for PC3 (due to an increase in e.g. taurine at \u03b4 = 3.28 and 2-aminoadipic acid at \u03b4 = 2.24, 1.64). Partial hepatectomy (L9), where entire liver lobes were removed, showed a similar increase in PC3, but still this group could be differentiated from L1 and L2. Other liver toxin groups, such as ANIT (L3, biliary, necrosis) and BHT (L5, centrilobular necrosis), showed opposite metabolic effects resulting in a decrease in PC3, and were well separated from hydrazine-induced liver toxicity.\nFig. 3 shows the best separation between controls (C), liver (L) and kidney (K) toxins using PLS-DA. It reveals that some samples from the kidney treatment group (K1, K3, K5) overlapped with samples from the liver treatment group. This most likely led to some misclassifications in the subsequent kNN classification runs. Many of the urines from the liver group clustered together and only L1 and L2 were significantly separated from the bulk of liver toxins. Late time points from studies L5 (BHT) and L9 (partial hepatectomy) overlapped with the control samples, suggesting that major effects in these studies were seen at early time points and that the urinary excretion profile at these later time points had returned close to normal. Finally, L1, L2 and K2, K4 showed the best separation between liver and kidney toxins as well as from control samples.\nHierarchical cluster analysis of the averaged spectra at each time point identified four main clusters (at a similarity level of approximately 0.7) (Fig. 4 ). Three of these clusters were composed of those studies showing the largest metabonomic effects: streptozotocin (O2) in one cluster, HCBD (K2) and mercury chloride (K4) in the second, and the two hydrazine studies (L1, L2) in the third cluster. This separation agreed well with the principal component analysis results.\nThe remaining cluster was separated into four distinct subgroups. The first subgroup contained samples from liver (L3, L5, L7) and kidney (K1, K3) dose groups. This especially highlights the aspect that some of the samples from the kidney toxin studies showed borderline-character between the classes liver and kidney, which was confirmed by the PLS-DA of control, liver and kidney samples (Fig. 3). One example is adriamycin (K1) which was assigned to the group of kidney toxins prior to analysis due to its predominant kidney toxicity, although slight histopathological liver effects were observed (decreased glycogen content). 2-Chloroethanamine (K3) was also found to show slight signs of liver toxicity (hepatitis, vacuolar degeneration and decreased glycogen). These findings indicate that the metabonomic analysis of urinary NMR data is sensitive to identifying toxin group similarities without detailed a priori knowledge of the histopathological characterisation. The second subgroup consisted entirely of samples from partially hepatectomised rats and indicated that although these samples showed some comparable effects to those of the hydrazine treatment group (Fig. 2), differences between the two were visible by HCA. The third sub-cluster consisted of predominantly liver treatment groups and two other studies (O3: chloroform, O5: food restriction). Chloroform induces both liver and kidney toxicity, while the food restriction study is likely to effect liver metabolism by glycogenolysis. The fourth subgroup was made up of mainly controls and control-like samples, e.g. late time points from treatment studies (K5, L5, L9). This emphasises the difference in time-response of animals to different toxins, i.e. onset and recovery. Those samples taken at a late time point from a study with an early recovery were more likely to show an excretion profile similar to control samples. Clustering of insulin (O1) into this subgroup indicates that the variance in the control cluster is larger than the subtle effects observed in the 8 h samples from insulin dosed animals. Overall, the analysis gives an asymmetric clustering structure with a strong tail. We attribute this appearance to the fact that many time points from several studies show a small effect, whereas fewer time points show stronger effects. For example, the first three clusters (studies O2, K2 & K4, L1 & L2) comprising 23 time points show the most prominent changes. Conversely, the fourth cluster, containing studies with weaker effects, is composed of 80 time points. This leads to \u2018overweighting\u2019 towards studies with smaller effects or even samples with high similarity to controls (mostly later time points in studies).\nHCA as an unsupervised technique not only identified clear organ-toxicity specific differences but also showed similarities between samples. The overlap between treatment groups helped to explain the misclassifications in the subsequent kNN analysis.\nThe most important goal in in vivo toxicity assessment is the determination of whether a drug is toxic, and subsequently which organ is affected. PCA, PLS-DA and especially HCA gave an impression of how well the different groups, defined by target organ, may be separated. Using the samples from the 19 studies taken at 48 h p.d., where the time point of maximum metabonomic effect was apparent in many of the studies, the classification into the three classes controls, liver and kidney resulted in greater than 85% correct prediction of the true class (Table 2 ) in LOO cross-validation using kNN. The best classification was achieved for the controls and liver treatment groups. Introducing a fourth class (other) led to a slight drop in correct classification of the control and liver group suggesting some misclassification into the other group. A total of 85% of the other group itself was predicted into the true class. As expected, it was more likely for those studies where the major metabonomic effect was seen at a different time point than 48 h to be misclassified as controls. This was true for the unilateral nephrectomy (K5) and the insulin treatment (O1) groups where major effects were only observed in the 8 h samples. Further reasons for misclassification were revealed in the HCA analysis, where studies from the other group (O3, O5) had close similarities to the liver group. In general, the use of training\u2013test-set (50:50) classification resulted in a slight reduction of 2\u20138% in the number of correct classification results compared to leave-one-out cross-validation, but provided a more robust model.\nThe importance of using the whole time-related urinary profile becomes obvious from the classification results obtained using all time points significantly different from controls (Table 3 ). Here, the classification of the samples resulted in a more even prediction success across the three groups (controls, liver, and kidney). LOO cross-validation resulted in greater than 90% true-class prediction. After introducing the other class, the correct prediction of the different classes in LOO cross-validation varied between 88 and 95% (training\u2013test-set classification: 85\u201391%).\nWith the exception of the liver group, all other classes showed an improvement from the use of more than one time point. The other group benefited from including the 8 h time point as this was important for the insulin study. In addition, the correct prediction of samples belonging to the kidney class increased due to the inclusion of the 8 h time point in study K5 (unilateral nephrectomy). Liver organ prediction was reduced (Table 4 ) due to the similarity of some of the late time points with control samples (L5, L9, see Fig. 4).\nIn general, our results for the organ-specific prediction suggest that the heterogeneity within the organ groups due to suborgan specific effects and different mechanisms of toxicity causes overlap between the groups. This will be taken into account while constructing larger databases. The use of a specific control model will ease the identification of important time points in the studies showing an effect compared to controls.\nTo investigate the next level of structure within the data, classifications were performed using each single toxicological study and the control samples as an individual class. Here, the study-by-study prediction employing all time points significantly different from controls (Table 5 ) was able to predict correctly the true class in 86% of cases using LOO cross-validation (81% for training\u2013test-set classification). Although the datasets analysed here have not been used to explore suborgan toxicity or toxic mechanisms specifically, the fact that each study can be clearly predicted as a separate class strongly suggests that such classification will be possible. We are currently exploring this aspect.\nAs a severe test, the division into subgroups can be pursued further so that the data is split into 87 classes where each class represents one treatment at one time point, plus one additional class for controls. With this time point-by-time point prediction (Table 5) the overall results for a correct time point prediction were between 64 and 67%, depending on the classification procedure. Fig. 5 illustrates the results from the training\u2013test-set prediction for every individual time point from the different studies. One axis shows the true class, the other axis those time points into which the samples were predicted (\u2018predicted class\u2019). The strong diagonal demonstrates that many of the samples were classified either into the correct time point of the right study, or into adjacent time points. This means that a sample which was not correctly classified into its time point was however closely predicted and mostly predicted into the right study. Reasons for misclassifications include the overlap between late time points from the treatment groups and control samples, and the similarity between the food restriction groups with 25 and 50% food reduction. As all time points from the studies together with controls amount to 88 classes, one would expect to assign a sample by chance to the correct class with a success rate of 1.1%, well below our success rates.\nSuccess of any prediction system will be determined by the selection of classes or subclasses and the number of samples in these classes. We are well aware that the ratio of samples in the different groups is an important aspect, and therefore we examined the impact of increasing the number of samples in the control group on the organ classification (48 h only). If the number of controls in our dataset was increased by approximately three-fold, the true-class prediction success for controls increased by 3% but this led to a decrease in classification success of 7% for the other group using LOO cross-validation. As this variance is due to strong overweighting, we expect our original dataset to be less affected.\nOur results show that the metabonomic approach of toxin prediction is highly competitive compared to other approaches using, e.g. genomic or proteomic information . Metabonomics has already proven useful in the description of liver and kidney toxicity using PCA and SIMCA . One application used probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) to predict toxin-affected organs in two different rat strains at an overall success rate of 94% . For each strain, samples were predicted into five classes (liver, kidney, liver & kidney, mitochondrial toxins and controls). The use of more diverse classes, such as multiple-organ toxicity (liver & kidney), should lead to improved classification results, however, kidney toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats was correctly predicted with 7% lower success rate using PNNs than with our approach using four distinct classes. Our dataset also contained a higher number of samples per class which strengthens the confidence in our results. In addition, the authors used SIMCA and multi-layer perceptrons for comparison with PNNs. However, both techniques proved to be less successful. An analytical method called CLassification Of Unknowns by Density Superposition (CLOUDS) was developed within the COMET project and is also presented in these proceedings . We have demonstrated that this non-neural technique, derived from PNNs, gave similar results within the error range compared to the robust and well-known kNN method when applied to the same data set. This emphasises the reliability of both approaches. Furthermore, CLOUDS can be tailored to complex tasks using diagnostics such as confidence and uniqueness which gives further flexibility to its use in multiparametric analysis.\nThe application of proteomic techniques as yet has played a minor role in the prediction of toxicity despite its wider use in mechanistic toxicology , however the genomic approach of using gene expression data from tissues for predicting toxicity (toxicogenomics) is becoming increasingly popular . In such studies messenger RNA information is extracted from liver tissue samples after treatment with different liver toxins. The gene expression data from 15 hepatotoxins were examined with clustering techniques revealing several similarities between different groups of the toxins and their correlation to histopathology and clinical chemistry findings . A prediction accuracy of 92% for the prediction of two toxin classes (enzyme inducers and peroxisome proliferators) was achieved using an approach with linear discriminant analysis and genetic algorithms/kNN . We have shown that the metabonomic approach can be applied to more complex classification tasks. So far, the gene expression classifications are very much focused on liver toxicity and liver subgroup-toxicity . And, although gene expression analysis has shown reasonable results in the examination of liver toxins, it is very labour-intensive requiring lengthy tissue preparation and PCR amplification and the cost of the micro-arrays is also considerable. These reasons often reduce the applicability of the technique to only single time points in the course of a toxicological study. The NMR analysis of urine samples meanwhile is easy and quick to perform which allows an immediate analysis at every important stage within the time course of a study. It is non-destructive and gives access to a variety of metabolic pathways\u2014a big advantage for high-throughput screening for drug toxicity.\nAs part of a larger effort to construct a comprehensive database of urinary metabonomic data from toxicological investigations, these preliminary results have underlined the potential of our approach for the prediction of drug toxicity. Data were employed from animal studies showing metabonomic effects due to toxin administration, surgical procedures (partial hepatectomy, unilateral nephrectomy) and other treatments (food restriction, water deprivation). It was shown that chemometric methods such as PCA, PLS-DA and HCA are important tools in the exploration and visualisation of toxicological effects in the rat. These techniques improve the understanding of the structure of metabonomic databases regarding toxin-, organ-, suborgan- and time-specificity. Within the COMET project, methods of chemometric modelling of NMR-derived, metabonomic data from animal studies are being developed for the prediction of drug toxicity. Our results, employing kNN classification suggested a good predictability of liver and kidney toxicity and other effects. More comprehensive classification based on suborgan-sites or mechanisms of toxicity is currently being explored."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nRecently, PDMS has become a highly attractive material for microfluidic chips because of its ease of fabrication. Unfortunately, for protein analysis, the hydrophobicity of the PDMS surface causes strong adsorption of proteins. Current methods to reduce protein binding include polymer grafting, biopassivation using an antibody\u2013neutravidin\u2013dextran coating, lipid bilayer formation on a plasma-oxidized PDMS surface, and coating with poly(vinyl alcohol). These methods have the drawback that either the treatment procedure is complex or the adsorption reduction (100\u20131000 fold) is not sufficient for some high sensitivity applications.\nn-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside (DDM) is an alkyl polyglucoside, which belongs to a family of very mild nonionic surfactants. It adsorbs strongly on hydrophobic surfaces, such as graphite, and forms a monolayer. This monolayer coverage causes the surface to become hydrophilic and nonionic, thus reducing the interaction between the protein and the surface. Because alkyl polyglucosides do not affect the functionality of many proteins, which has been demonstrated by solublizing proteins without denaturation, we can keep a certain concentration of DDM in the solution so that it equilibrates with the adsorbed surfactant molecules. Dynamic coating with ionic reagents has been used to change the electroosmotic flow (EOF) in PDMS channels. For nonionic surfactants, Towns and Regnier have demonstrated that the dynamic coating of alkylsilane-modified silica capillaries with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based surfactant reduces the surface adsorption of analyte proteins in capillary electrophoresis. This result suggested to us that a DDM coating could be efficient in reducing protein nonspecific binding on the hydrophobic PDMS surface.\nTo monitor the protein adsorption, we use fluorescence imaging either with epifluorescence, wide-field excitation, or with total internal reflection (TIR) excitation. We use 1 \u00b5M Alexa Fluor 647 labeled streptavidin or bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Hepes buffered saline (HBS) containing 20 mM Hepes and 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.5. For achieving a dynamic DDM coating, we use HBS with 0.1% DDM, which we refer to as DHBS. The protein solution in HBS or DHBS is injected into a 100 \u00b5m high \u00d7 1 mm wide \u00d7 25 mm long rectangular PDMS channel and then removed with HBS or DHBS after an incubation time of 5 min. The buffer washing is performed either (1) by flushing 50 \u00b5L buffer in about 2.5 s with a pipet or (2) by flowing buffer at 1 mL h\u22121 for 3 min (50 \u00b5L), which results in almost identical surface fluorescence (Table 1).\nWithout DDM in the buffer, both streptavidin and BSA adsorb strongly to the PDMS surface, yielding bright, homogeneous fluorescence emission at low excitation power (0.15 W cm\u22122 at the sample) (Figs. 1A and D). In contrast, with DHBS, only scattered fluorescent spots can be observed under much higher excitation power (8.9 W cm\u22122) and TIR excitation (Figs. 1B and E). Stepwise photobleaching of these spots can be observed (Fig. 1F). As a control, a PDMS surface treated with DHBS does not show significant fluorescence under the same excitation conditions (Fig. 1C). According to the manufacturer, the sample proteins are labeled with an average of about three dye molecules per protein. We conclude that these fluorescent spots are actually individual protein molecules. Therefore, with DDM dynamic coating, the nonspecific binding of streptavidin and BSA on PDMS is almost completely eliminated (an estimated 106 fold reduction) without any separate surface treatment.\nWe have also tested the effect of 0.1% DDM on reducing the surface adsorption of cytochrome c, an antibody (mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody), and a transmembrane protein (\u03b22 adrenergic receptor), all of which show scattered molecules on the surface even with high protein concentration, while maintaining the activity of each protein. Thus, DDM dynamic coating can be applied to a wide variety of systems in which the presence of a small percentage of DDM can be tolerated.\nIn a few situations, DDM in the buffer solution could still affect adversely the experimental system, suggesting the use of a permanent coating. Geffroy et al. have shown that PEG-based nonionic surfactants remain adsorbed onto the hydrophobic polystyrene surface after removing surfactants in the solution, which is attributed to the strong hydrophobic interaction between the alkyl chain and the surface. Because of the structural similarity, we expected that DDM should also irreversibly adsorb to PDMS.\nTo test the permanent coating of the PDMS surface with DDM, the PDMS channel is incubated with DHBS for 5 min and then washed either with pipet flushing (50 \u00b5L HBS) or with constant flow (1 mL h\u22121). The channel is subsequently incubated with protein/HBS solution for 5 min and then washed with HBS. In the case of pipet flushing, the amount of streptavidin bound to the PDMS surface is reduced by a factor of 102 (Table 1). With the other method, we have found that longer washing times favor the reduction of protein adsorption. As can be seen in Fig. 2, extending the washing time from 2.5 min to 10 min reduces the nonspecifically bound streptavidin to the single molecule level. Further increase in washing time up to 1 h does not significantly change the binding of streptavidin or BSA, indicating that the DDM coating is stable.\nWe find continuous washing is necessary for efficient DDM coating. For example, after pipet washing, if we incubate the channel with HBS for 1 h without flowing, the streptavidin adsorption is only slightly lower than the case without such incubation (Table 1). This phenomenon might be caused by the same mechanism as the desorption behavior of PEG surfactants observed by Geffroy et al., in which it takes about 5 min for the surface-bound surfactants to desorb and equilibrate with the buffer. Thus, continuous washing would be able to remove the DDM molecules that are desorbed from the surface and allows DDM on the surface to rearrange its configuration. The exact mechanism is under investigation.\nIn addition to its ability to suppress protein adsorption, the DDM coating also reduces the EOF by covering the charges on the PDMS surface. Our measurements using current monitoring method show that the electroosmotic mobility of 20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 8) in a PDMS channel is reduced from 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 to 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 (dynamic coating) or 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 (permanent coating). Such EOF reduction is beneficial in many cases.\nIn conclusion, DDM coating, dynamic or permanent, is a simple, but highly efficient method to minimize protein adsorption to a PDMS surface. The hydrophobic interaction between the alkyl chain of DDM and the PDMS surface promotes binding and causes the resulting surface to be passivated. We propose that DDM coating might become a general procedure for reducing nonspecific protein adsorption on other hydrophobic surfaces, such as alkylsilane-modified silica surfaces and alkylthiol-modified gold surfaces.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

The buffer washing is performed either (1) by flushing 50 \u00b5L buffer in about 2.5 s with a pipet or (2) by flowing buffer at 1 mL h\u22121 for 3 min (50 \u00b5L), which results in almost identical surface fluorescence (Table 1).\nWithout DDM in the buffer, both streptavidin and BSA adsorb strongly to the PDMS surface, yielding bright, homogeneous fluorescence emission at low excitation power (0.15 W cm\u22122 at the sample) (Figs. 1A and D). In contrast, with DHBS, only scattered fluorescent spots can be observed under much higher excitation power (8.9 W cm\u22122) and TIR excitation (Figs. 1B and E). Stepwise photobleaching of these spots can be observed (Fig. 1F). As a control, a PDMS surface treated with DHBS does not show significant fluorescence under the same excitation conditions (Fig. 1C). According to the manufacturer, the sample proteins are labeled with an average of about three dye molecules per protein. We conclude that these fluorescent spots are actually individual protein molecules. Therefore, with DDM dynamic coating, the nonspecific binding of streptavidin and BSA on PDMS is almost completely eliminated (an estimated 106 fold reduction) without any separate surface treatment.\nWe have also tested the effect of 0.1% DDM on reducing the surface adsorption of cytochrome c, an antibody (mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody), and a transmembrane protein (\u03b22 adrenergic receptor), all of which show scattered molecules on the surface even with high protein concentration, while maintaining the activity of each protein. Thus, DDM dynamic coating can be applied to a wide variety of systems in which the presence of a small percentage of DDM can be tolerated.\nIn a few situations, DDM in the buffer solution could still affect adversely the experimental system, suggesting the use of a permanent coating. Geffroy et al. have shown that PEG-based nonionic surfactants remain adsorbed onto the hydrophobic polystyrene surface after removing surfactants in the solution, which is attributed to the strong hydrophobic interaction between the alkyl chain and the surface. Because of the structural similarity, we expected that DDM should also irreversibly adsorb to PDMS.\nTo test the permanent coating of the PDMS surface with DDM, the PDMS channel is incubated with DHBS for 5 min and then washed either with pipet flushing (50 \u00b5L HBS) or with constant flow (1 mL h\u22121). The channel is subsequently incubated with protein/HBS solution for 5 min and then washed with HBS. In the case of pipet flushing, the amount of streptavidin bound to the PDMS surface is reduced by a factor of 102 (Table 1). With the other method, we have found that longer washing times favor the reduction of protein adsorption. As can be seen in Fig. 2, extending the washing time from 2.5 min to 10 min reduces the nonspecifically bound streptavidin to the single molecule level. Further increase in washing time up to 1 h does not significantly change the binding of streptavidin or BSA, indicating that the DDM coating is stable.\nWe find continuous washing is necessary for efficient DDM coating. For example, after pipet washing, if we incubate the channel with HBS for 1 h without flowing, the streptavidin adsorption is only slightly lower than the case without such incubation (Table 1). This phenomenon might be caused by the same mechanism as the desorption behavior of PEG surfactants observed by Geffroy et al., in which it takes about 5 min for the surface-bound surfactants to desorb and equilibrate with the buffer. Thus, continuous washing would be able to remove the DDM molecules that are desorbed from the surface and allows DDM on the surface to rearrange its configuration. The exact mechanism is under investigation.\nIn addition to its ability to suppress protein adsorption, the DDM coating also reduces the EOF by covering the charges on the PDMS surface. Our measurements using current monitoring method show that the electroosmotic mobility of 20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 8) in a PDMS channel is reduced from 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 to 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 (dynamic coating) or 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 (permanent coating). Such EOF reduction is beneficial in many cases.\nIn conclusion, DDM coating, dynamic or permanent, is a simple, but highly efficient method to minimize protein adsorption to a PDMS surface. The hydrophobic interaction between the alkyl chain of DDM and the PDMS surface promotes binding and causes the resulting surface to be passivated. We propose that DDM coating might become a general procedure for reducing nonspecific protein adsorption on other hydrophobic surfaces, such as alkylsilane-modified silica surfaces and alkylthiol-modified gold surfaces."

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nAs a material science expert, utilize your expertise to analyze the provided scientific paper.\n\n### Input:\nHere is a scientific paper:\nAromatic amines, such as aniline and its substituted derivatives, are generally dangerous because of their toxicity and carcinogenicity or else they can be converted into toxic N-nitroso compounds through reactions with nitrosylating agents in the environment . These contaminants may be released as chemical residues of dyestuffs, cosmetics, medicines and rubber manufacture and also as by-products of energy technologies such as coal-conversion waste processing . Chlorinated anilines such as p-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline were also found as degradation products and intermediates of various phenylurea and phenylcarbamate pesticides . In view of the importance of these compounds, a rapid and sensitive method of analysis is needed to detect them in the environment.\nSeveral methods have been developed for the determination of anilines in environmental samples. Gas chromatography (GC) is a classical method , and presently GC\u2013mass spectrometry (MS) is often used . For non-volatile aniline compounds high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) may be used with fluorescence detection after derivatization , or with amperometric detection . Some sample preparation techniques have been reported for the pretreatment of anilines in aqueous samples based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) . In the past years, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has emerged as a versatile solvent-free alternative to SPE procedures. In recent years, a novel technique termed liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) has been developed. However a fast simple preconcentration and microextraction method, DLLME has been presented in 2006 for determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) and chlorobenzenes (CBs) in water samples and for the first time, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization combined with gas chromatography-electroncapture detection (GC-ECD) were studied for the analysis of 19 chlorophenols (CPs) in water samples . In this method, the appropriate mixture of extraction solvent and disperser solvent are injected into the aqueous sample (5 ml) by syringe, rapidly. Therefore, cloudy solution is formed. In fact, it is consisted of fine particles of extraction solvent which is dispersed entirely into aqueous phase. After centrifuging, the fine particles of extraction solvent are sedimented in the bottom of the conical test tube. The advantages of DLLME method are simplicity of operation, rapidity, low-cost, high-recovery, and enrichment factor.\nIn the present work, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization have been carried out in one-step for the analysis of anilines in water samples at the sub-ppb level and various parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were also investigated in this study.\nAll chemicals used in this study were reagent grade, aniline and 4-chloroaniline were obtained (purity > 99%) from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), 3-chloro-2-methylaniline and 3,5-dichloroaniline were purchased (purity \u2267 98%) from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Portugal). Derivatization reagent pentafluorobenzaldehyde (PFBAY) was purchased from Alfa-Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA), chlorobenzene (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), tetrachloroethylene (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), tetrachlorocarbon (Showa Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), acetone (Echo, Maioli, Taiwan), acetonitrile (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), and methanol (Echo, Maioli, Taiwan) were also used for this study.\nThe stock solutions were prepared by adding approximately 3 mg of analytes into vials and diluted to 10 ml with methanol. The stock solutions were kept storage at 4 \u00b0C. Before extraction, stock solutions were diluted with blank stream water to aqueous standard of 33 \u03bcg/l (aniline), 57 \u03bcg/l (4-chloroaniline), 62 \u03bcg/l (3-chloro-2-methylaniline), and 48 \u03bcg/l (3,5-dichloroaniline) for the optimization experiments. A waste water from Tou Cian stream (Hsinchu, Taiwan) served as the environmental sample.\nAnalysis was carried-out using a gas chromatograph Agilent (Wilmington, Delaware, USA) 6850 with split/splitless injector operated at 250 \u00b0C in pulse splitless mode (1 min), mass detector Agilent (Wilmington, Delaware, USA) 5978B. A 30 m HP-5MS (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) fused silica capillary column (0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness) was used for separation. The column oven was initially held at 70 \u00b0C, raised to 295 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C/min, held at 295 \u00b0C for 1 min. The carrier gas was helium (purity 99.9995%); it was further purified by passage through a superior helium gas purifier Agilent (Wilmington, DE, USA) model RMSH-2. A Sorvall 5C Plus Centrifuge (Global Medical, Ramsey, MN, USA) was used.\nAll of the 10 ml screw cap conical bottomed glass test tubes (extraction vessel) were manufactured by Ching Fa glass factory (Hsingchu, Taiwan).\nDeionized water was prepared using a Milli-Q (Millipore, MA, USA) purification system.\nIn the simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, an aliquot of 5 ml of a blank stream solution containing 33 \u03bcg/l (aniline), 57 \u03bcg/l (4-chloroaniline), 62 \u03bcg/l (3-chloro-2-methylaniline), and 48 \u03bcg/l (3,5-dichloroaniline) was placed in a 10 ml screw cap conical bottomed glass test tube. An aliquot of 0.5 ml of acetone (disperser solvent) containing 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene (extraction solvent) and 10 \u03bcl methanol containing PFBAY (30 g/l, derivatization reagent) was injected rapidly into the aqueous solution with a 1 ml syringe (gastight, Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) and a 10 \u03bcl syringe (gastight, Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA), then the mentioned mixture was kept in a water bath (30 \u00b0C). Dispersed fine droplets of chlorobenzene form a cloudy solution. In this step, anilines and PFBAY were extracted into the fine droplet of chlorobenzene rapidly and derivatized in the chlorobenzene, in 20 min. After centrifugation for 2 min at 6000 rpm, fine droplets of extraction solvent were sedimented at the bottom of the conical test tube. The volume of the sedimented phase was determined to approximately 2 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcl. The sedimented phase (2 \u03bcl) was injected into GC for separation and analysis.\nFor evaluating the pretreatment procedure, the sensitivities of two experiments were compared. In the first experiment, derivatization reagent was added to aqueous sample containing anilines to proceed derivative reaction for 20 min, then 0.5 ml acetone including 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene was injected into above aqueous sample and then the centrifugation was proceeded in 2 min. In the second experiment, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, 0.5 ml acetone including 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene and derivatization reagent were injected into aqueous sample spiked with anilines, and then centrifugation was proceeded after 20 min. As shown in Fig. 1 , better sensitivity was obtained, except for 3,5-dichloroaniline with similar sensitivity, with simultaneous DLLME and derivatization. It was inferred that difference of sensitivity of anilines between experiment 1 and 2 should be affected by the solubility of anilines in water (Table 1 ) . Therefore simultaneous derivatization and extraction was decided to be the pretreatment procedure.\nIn DLLME method, some characteristics of extraction solvent such as low solubility in water, extraction capability of interested compounds, good chromatographic behavior and higher density than water must be achieved. Thus there are extra limitations on the selection of extraction solvent in DLLME method. Most of the halogenated solvents own above properties.\nTo obtain the better extraction efficiency, chlorobenzene, tetrachloroethylene, and tetrachlorocarbon were tested as extraction solvents. A 5 ml of aqueous sample containing the target compounds were extracted using the procedure described above.\nAs shown in Fig. 2 , the extraction efficiency of aniline and 4-chloroaniline extracted with tetrachlorocarbon were higher than other solvents but from the view of average sensitivity for these four analytes, chlorobenzene was selected as the extraction solvent.\nDisperser solvent should be miscible in water; also it should dissolve the extraction solvent. Thus acetone and acetonitrile were selected as disperser solvents to investigate the effect of these solvents on the performance of DLLME.\nWhen acetone and acetonitrile were tested as disperser solvents containing chlorobenzene to inject into aqueous sample, as shown in the following result (Fig. 3 ), extraction efficiency of acetone was similar to acetonitrile but acetone was less toxic, referred with LC50, than acetonitrile . Consequently, the acetone was selected as disperser solvent because of less toxicity and cheaper.\nFor investigating the effect of volume of disperser solvent on extraction efficiency, various volumes of acetone (0.5, 1, 1.5 ml) containing (10, 13, 16.5 \u03bcl) chlorobenzene were performed, respectively. Increasing the volume of chlorobenzene by increasing the volume of acetone is required to obtain the constant volume of the sedimented phase (3 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcl). As shown in Fig. 4 , the optimized sensitivity was achieved when 0.5 ml acetone and 10 \u03bcl of chlorobenzene were used.\nIncreasing extraction solvent would increase extracted amount of analytes, however the concentration of analytes in the sedimented phase were also diluted. For enhancing sensitivity, 2 \u03bcl of sedimented phase was injected to GC\u2013MS. Over 2 \u03bcl of injection would cause peak broaden. Here 8.75 and 10 \u03bcl of extraction solvent was used to study for obtaining the effect of 2 and 3 \u03bcl of sedimented phase on extraction efficiency. There is no considerable change on the extraction efficiency of these anilines between 8.75 and 10 \u03bcl of extraction solvent. Consequently, 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene was selected.\nIn this work, the matrices in the river water would influence derivatization and extraction efficiency. Here, different pH values (4, 4.6, 5, 7.8) in sample solution were adjusted to investigate the derivatization and extraction efficiency. The lower sensitivity of stream water (pH 7.8) was observed. Higher sensitivity was acquired as lowering pH value, however sensitivity descended below pH 4.6. As shown in Fig. 5 , the better derivatization and extraction efficiency would be obtained at pH 4.6.\nIn simultaneous extraction and derivatization with DLLME, raising temperature would cause different derivatization performance and solubility of analytes in aqueous. Here, various extraction and derivatization temperatures were investigated to obtain the better extraction efficiency. As shown in Fig. 6 , the sensitivity decreased by increasing extraction and derivatization temperature from 30 to 60 \u00b0C. Thus 30 \u00b0C was used for further study.\nIn simultaneous extraction and derivatization with DLLME, dispersed fine droplets of chlorobenzene form a cloudy solution and the surface area between extraction solvent and aqueous phase (water sample) is very large. Transition of anilines and PFBAY from aqueous phase (water sample) to extraction solvent is fast enough to let a quick achieve of the equilibrium state. Thereby, most of the required time was for derivatization of anilines with PFBAY.\nVarious experiments were performed in the range of 0\u201350 min to obtain the better extraction efficiency. As shown in Fig. 7 , there is no considerable change on the sensitivity of these anilines after 20 min and 20 min was selected for extraction and derivatization time.\nThe characteristics of analytes were listed in Table 2 . Enrichment factors, which were defined as formula 1, achieved by the DLLME procedure were 212\u2013645-fold. The linearity of the DLLME for blank water samples of anilines detected by GC\u2013MS was investigated with spiked concentrations of analytes ranging from 0.25 to 70 \u03bcg/l; and method detection limits (MDLs), which were calculated as three times the standard deviation of five replicated runs of spiked samples at lowest concentration of calibration curve, were in the range 0.04\u20130.09 \u03bcg/l. Correlation coefficients, (R 2) values, were between 0.9955 and 0.9985. Linear equation was used to calculate R 2 for GC\u2013MS. The range of the relative standard deviations is 5.8\u201311.8% (Table 3 ): enrichmentfactor=VsCsVaqC0 where C s is the concentration of analytes in sediment phase after extraction, V s the volume of sediment phase for injecting to GC, V aq the volume of sample solution and C 0 is the initial concentration of analytes in aqueous sample before extraction.\nThe optimum condition for each factor may be inter-related. The conditions we finally selected may not be the optimum. However, we have checked back and forth the conditions from time to time. For instance, the data shown in Fig. 1 should be run at the beginning of the experiment. We have re-run the experiment using the selected conditions we found at the final stage. In Fig. 2, the selectivity for the less sensitive analytes, 3-chloro-2-methylaniline and 3,5-dichloroaniline, was much better as using chlorobenzene for extraction solvent, it therefore may not absolutely required to check it once again. For Fig. 3, the extraction efficiencies were similar using acetone or acetonitrile. Acetone was selected as disperser solvent because of less toxic and cheaper (Refs. ). Similar situation can be found from the date shown in other figures.\nStream waste water sample was filtered through a filter paper before analysis. The aqueous samples were extracted with DLLME under the selected conditions. The selected conditions were listed as below: (1) disperser solvent, acetone; (2) extraction solvent, chlorobenzene; (3) amount of disperser solvent, 0.5 ml; (4) amount of extraction solvent, 8.75 \u03bcl; (5) pH value of sample solution, 4.6; (6) derivatization and extraction temperature, 30 \u00b0C; (7) derivatization and extraction time, 20 min. No anilines were detected in the stream water samples (Tou Cian stream) neighbor to the dye factory tested. The relative recoveries defined as the peak area ratio between blank stream water and the tested stream water sample, which was free of the analytes, spiked at the same concentration (2.5, 2.5, 5, 5 \u03bcg/l) was found to be 69\u201394% (Table 3). No analytes were detected in the stream waste water sample (Fig. 8 ).\nThis work indicates that a selective trace enrichment of carcinogenic anilines from river water samples can be achieved by a DLLME method. The newly developed microextraction technique has distinct advantages over conventional methods with respect to extraction time and volume of solvents required, and low detection limits are readily achieved. This proposed sample preparation procedure is much simpler than the conventional LLE, SPE, and SPME.\n\nGiven the provided scientific paper, please complete the following two steps:\nStep 1: Keyword Extraction\n\nRead the scientific paper and identify 15 keywords that capture the most important terms and concepts in the paper, avoiding generic or broad terms.

        "txt": "Aromatic amines, such as aniline and its substituted derivatives, are generally dangerous because of their toxicity and carcinogenicity or else they can be converted into toxic N-nitroso compounds through reactions with nitrosylating agents in the environment . These contaminants may be released as chemical residues of dyestuffs, cosmetics, medicines and rubber manufacture and also as by-products of energy technologies such as coal-conversion waste processing . Chlorinated anilines such as p-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline were also found as degradation products and intermediates of various phenylurea and phenylcarbamate pesticides . In view of the importance of these compounds, a rapid and sensitive method of analysis is needed to detect them in the environment.\nSeveral methods have been developed for the determination of anilines in environmental samples. Gas chromatography (GC) is a classical method , and presently GC\u2013mass spectrometry (MS) is often used . For non-volatile aniline compounds high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) may be used with fluorescence detection after derivatization , or with amperometric detection . Some sample preparation techniques have been reported for the pretreatment of anilines in aqueous samples based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) . In the past years, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has emerged as a versatile solvent-free alternative to SPE procedures. In recent years, a novel technique termed liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) has been developed. However a fast simple preconcentration and microextraction method, DLLME has been presented in 2006 for determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) and chlorobenzenes (CBs) in water samples and for the first time, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization combined with gas chromatography-electroncapture detection (GC-ECD) were studied for the analysis of 19 chlorophenols (CPs) in water samples . In this method, the appropriate mixture of extraction solvent and disperser solvent are injected into the aqueous sample (5 ml) by syringe, rapidly. Therefore, cloudy solution is formed. In fact, it is consisted of fine particles of extraction solvent which is dispersed entirely into aqueous phase. After centrifuging, the fine particles of extraction solvent are sedimented in the bottom of the conical test tube. The advantages of DLLME method are simplicity of operation, rapidity, low-cost, high-recovery, and enrichment factor.\nIn the present work, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization have been carried out in one-step for the analysis of anilines in water samples at the sub-ppb level and various parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were also investigated in this study.\nAll chemicals used in this study were reagent grade, aniline and 4-chloroaniline were obtained (purity > 99%) from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), 3-chloro-2-methylaniline and 3,5-dichloroaniline were purchased (purity \u2267 98%) from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Portugal). Derivatization reagent pentafluorobenzaldehyde (PFBAY) was purchased from Alfa-Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA), chlorobenzene (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), tetrachloroethylene (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), tetrachlorocarbon (Showa Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), acetone (Echo, Maioli, Taiwan), acetonitrile (J.T. Baker, Mallinckrodt, Baker), and methanol (Echo, Maioli, Taiwan) were also used for this study.\nThe stock solutions were prepared by adding approximately 3 mg of analytes into vials and diluted to 10 ml with methanol. The stock solutions were kept storage at 4 \u00b0C. Before extraction, stock solutions were diluted with blank stream water to aqueous standard of 33 \u03bcg/l (aniline), 57 \u03bcg/l (4-chloroaniline), 62 \u03bcg/l (3-chloro-2-methylaniline), and 48 \u03bcg/l (3,5-dichloroaniline) for the optimization experiments. A waste water from Tou Cian stream (Hsinchu, Taiwan) served as the environmental sample.\nAnalysis was carried-out using a gas chromatograph Agilent (Wilmington, Delaware, USA) 6850 with split/splitless injector operated at 250 \u00b0C in pulse splitless mode (1 min), mass detector Agilent (Wilmington, Delaware, USA) 5978B. A 30 m HP-5MS (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) fused silica capillary column (0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness) was used for separation. The column oven was initially held at 70 \u00b0C, raised to 295 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C/min, held at 295 \u00b0C for 1 min. The carrier gas was helium (purity 99.9995%); it was further purified by passage through a superior helium gas purifier Agilent (Wilmington, DE, USA) model RMSH-2. A Sorvall 5C Plus Centrifuge (Global Medical, Ramsey, MN, USA) was used.\nAll of the 10 ml screw cap conical bottomed glass test tubes (extraction vessel) were manufactured by Ching Fa glass factory (Hsingchu, Taiwan).\nDeionized water was prepared using a Milli-Q (Millipore, MA, USA) purification system.\nIn the simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, an aliquot of 5 ml of a blank stream solution containing 33 \u03bcg/l (aniline), 57 \u03bcg/l (4-chloroaniline), 62 \u03bcg/l (3-chloro-2-methylaniline), and 48 \u03bcg/l (3,5-dichloroaniline) was placed in a 10 ml screw cap conical bottomed glass test tube. An aliquot of 0.5 ml of acetone (disperser solvent) containing 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene (extraction solvent) and 10 \u03bcl methanol containing PFBAY (30 g/l, derivatization reagent) was injected rapidly into the aqueous solution with a 1 ml syringe (gastight, Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) and a 10 \u03bcl syringe (gastight, Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA), then the mentioned mixture was kept in a water bath (30 \u00b0C). Dispersed fine droplets of chlorobenzene form a cloudy solution. In this step, anilines and PFBAY were extracted into the fine droplet of chlorobenzene rapidly and derivatized in the chlorobenzene, in 20 min. After centrifugation for 2 min at 6000 rpm, fine droplets of extraction solvent were sedimented at the bottom of the conical test tube. The volume of the sedimented phase was determined to approximately 2 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcl. The sedimented phase (2 \u03bcl) was injected into GC for separation and analysis.\nFor evaluating the pretreatment procedure, the sensitivities of two experiments were compared. In the first experiment, derivatization reagent was added to aqueous sample containing anilines to proceed derivative reaction for 20 min, then 0.5 ml acetone including 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene was injected into above aqueous sample and then the centrifugation was proceeded in 2 min. In the second experiment, simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, 0.5 ml acetone including 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene and derivatization reagent were injected into aqueous sample spiked with anilines, and then centrifugation was proceeded after 20 min. As shown in Fig. 1 , better sensitivity was obtained, except for 3,5-dichloroaniline with similar sensitivity, with simultaneous DLLME and derivatization. It was inferred that difference of sensitivity of anilines between experiment 1 and 2 should be affected by the solubility of anilines in water (Table 1 ) . Therefore simultaneous derivatization and extraction was decided to be the pretreatment procedure.\nIn DLLME method, some characteristics of extraction solvent such as low solubility in water, extraction capability of interested compounds, good chromatographic behavior and higher density than water must be achieved. Thus there are extra limitations on the selection of extraction solvent in DLLME method. Most of the halogenated solvents own above properties.\nTo obtain the better extraction efficiency, chlorobenzene, tetrachloroethylene, and tetrachlorocarbon were tested as extraction solvents. A 5 ml of aqueous sample containing the target compounds were extracted using the procedure described above.\nAs shown in Fig. 2 , the extraction efficiency of aniline and 4-chloroaniline extracted with tetrachlorocarbon were higher than other solvents but from the view of average sensitivity for these four analytes, chlorobenzene was selected as the extraction solvent.\nDisperser solvent should be miscible in water; also it should dissolve the extraction solvent. Thus acetone and acetonitrile were selected as disperser solvents to investigate the effect of these solvents on the performance of DLLME.\nWhen acetone and acetonitrile were tested as disperser solvents containing chlorobenzene to inject into aqueous sample, as shown in the following result (Fig. 3 ), extraction efficiency of acetone was similar to acetonitrile but acetone was less toxic, referred with LC50, than acetonitrile . Consequently, the acetone was selected as disperser solvent because of less toxicity and cheaper.\nFor investigating the effect of volume of disperser solvent on extraction efficiency, various volumes of acetone (0.5, 1, 1.5 ml) containing (10, 13, 16.5 \u03bcl) chlorobenzene were performed, respectively. Increasing the volume of chlorobenzene by increasing the volume of acetone is required to obtain the constant volume of the sedimented phase (3 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcl). As shown in Fig. 4 , the optimized sensitivity was achieved when 0.5 ml acetone and 10 \u03bcl of chlorobenzene were used.\nIncreasing extraction solvent would increase extracted amount of analytes, however the concentration of analytes in the sedimented phase were also diluted. For enhancing sensitivity, 2 \u03bcl of sedimented phase was injected to GC\u2013MS. Over 2 \u03bcl of injection would cause peak broaden. Here 8.75 and 10 \u03bcl of extraction solvent was used to study for obtaining the effect of 2 and 3 \u03bcl of sedimented phase on extraction efficiency. There is no considerable change on the extraction efficiency of these anilines between 8.75 and 10 \u03bcl of extraction solvent. Consequently, 8.75 \u03bcl chlorobenzene was selected.\nIn this work, the matrices in the river water would influence derivatization and extraction efficiency. Here, different pH values (4, 4.6, 5, 7.8) in sample solution were adjusted to investigate the derivatization and extraction efficiency. The lower sensitivity of stream water (pH 7.8) was observed. Higher sensitivity was acquired as lowering pH value, however sensitivity descended below pH 4.6. As shown in Fig. 5 , the better derivatization and extraction efficiency would be obtained at pH 4.6.\nIn simultaneous extraction and derivatization with DLLME, raising temperature would cause different derivatization performance and solubility of analytes in aqueous. Here, various extraction and derivatization temperatures were investigated to obtain the better extraction efficiency. As shown in Fig. 6 , the sensitivity decreased by increasing extraction and derivatization temperature from 30 to 60 \u00b0C. Thus 30 \u00b0C was used for further study.\nIn simultaneous extraction and derivatization with DLLME, dispersed fine droplets of chlorobenzene form a cloudy solution and the surface area between extraction solvent and aqueous phase (water sample) is very large. Transition of anilines and PFBAY from aqueous phase (water sample) to extraction solvent is fast enough to let a quick achieve of the equilibrium state. Thereby, most of the required time was for derivatization of anilines with PFBAY.\nVarious experiments were performed in the range of 0\u201350 min to obtain the better extraction efficiency. As shown in Fig. 7 , there is no considerable change on the sensitivity of these anilines after 20 min and 20 min was selected for extraction and derivatization time.\nThe characteristics of analytes were listed in Table 2 . Enrichment factors, which were defined as formula 1, achieved by the DLLME procedure were 212\u2013645-fold. The linearity of the DLLME for blank water samples of anilines detected by GC\u2013MS was investigated with spiked concentrations of analytes ranging from 0.25 to 70 \u03bcg/l; and method detection limits (MDLs), which were calculated as three times the standard deviation of five replicated runs of spiked samples at lowest concentration of calibration curve, were in the range 0.04\u20130.09 \u03bcg/l. Correlation coefficients, (R 2) values, were between 0.9955 and 0.9985. Linear equation was used to calculate R 2 for GC\u2013MS. The range of the relative standard deviations is 5.8\u201311.8% (Table 3 ): enrichmentfactor=VsCsVaqC0 where C s is the concentration of analytes in sediment phase after extraction, V s the volume of sediment phase for injecting to GC, V aq the volume of sample solution and C 0 is the initial concentration of analytes in aqueous sample before extraction.\nThe optimum condition for each factor may be inter-related. The conditions we finally selected may not be the optimum. However, we have checked back and forth the conditions from time to time. For instance, the data shown in Fig. 1 should be run at the beginning of the experiment. We have re-run the experiment using the selected conditions we found at the final stage. In Fig. 2, the selectivity for the less sensitive analytes, 3-chloro-2-methylaniline and 3,5-dichloroaniline, was much better as using chlorobenzene for extraction solvent, it therefore may not absolutely required to check it once again. For Fig. 3, the extraction efficiencies were similar using acetone or acetonitrile. Acetone was selected as disperser solvent because of less toxic and cheaper (Refs. ). Similar situation can be found from the date shown in other figures.\nStream waste water sample was filtered through a filter paper before analysis. The aqueous samples were extracted with DLLME under the selected conditions. The selected conditions were listed as below: (1) disperser solvent, acetone; (2) extraction solvent, chlorobenzene; (3) amount of disperser solvent, 0.5 ml; (4) amount of extraction solvent, 8.75 \u03bcl; (5) pH value of sample solution, 4.6; (6) derivatization and extraction temperature, 30 \u00b0C; (7) derivatization and extraction time, 20 min. No anilines were detected in the stream water samples (Tou Cian stream) neighbor to the dye factory tested. The relative recoveries defined as the peak area ratio between blank stream water and the tested stream water sample, which was free of the analytes, spiked at the same concentration (2.5, 2.5, 5, 5 \u03bcg/l) was found to be 69\u201394% (Table 3). No analytes were detected in the stream waste water sample (Fig. 8 ).\nThis work indicates that a selective trace enrichment of carcinogenic anilines from river water samples can be achieved by a DLLME method. The newly developed microextraction technique has distinct advantages over conventional methods with respect to extraction time and volume of solvents required, and low detection limits are readily achieved. This proposed sample preparation procedure is much simpler than the conventional LLE, SPE, and SPME."
