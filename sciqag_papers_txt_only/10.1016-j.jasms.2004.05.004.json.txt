Serum albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulatory system. The most important physiological function of serum albumin is to maintain the osmotic pressure and pH of blood , and transport a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds including fatty acids, metal, amino acids, steroids and drugs . Because of these extraordinary characteristics, albumins from various sources have gained extensive biomedical and industrial applications as well as research interest. The crystal structure of human serum albumin (HSA) has been determined and the interaction with fatty acids has been studied for HSA and bovine serum albumin (BSA) . Although the conformation of BSA is thought to be similar to HSA due to 76% of amino acid sequence homology, the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of BSA has yet to be characterized.
The biological function of a protein depends on its conformation. The most informative method to study the 3-D structure of proteins is X-ray crystallography. The X-ray crystallography, which provides information regarding the atomic distances of a crystallized compound, is not always applicable because not all proteins can be readily crystallized. In addition, proteins rarely exist as crystals under physiological conditions, but are soluble in cytosol or associated with the membrane or other components of the cell. A native biochemical condition is often required to maintain an optimal biological activity of proteins. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can generate the tertiary structural information of proteins in solution, and therefore, complementing X-ray crystallography. However, both techniques require large amount of samples, imposing limitations in many biological settings.
Over the past years mass spectrometry, in conjunction with chemical cross-linking, has emerged as a sensitive tool for probing the tertiary structure of proteins . A protein is modified covalently by bi-functional cross-linking reagents, followed by proteolytic digestion. Cross-linked peptides are analyzed by mass spectrometry to assign the amino acid residues participating in the cross-linking. The maximum distance between the cross-linked residues is dependent on the cross-linker arm length. This information generates the intramolecular distance constraints, assisting computational method to determine the 3-D atomic arrangement of a protein. The approach is rapid and requires small amounts of proteins with no limitation on the size of the molecule. In addition, the method can be applied in native biochemical conditions, showing promises in studying conformational changes of a protein associated with its biological function. Recently, Back et al. has used the O-18 labeled proteolysis to unambiguously recognize the cross-linking between two peptide segments . In the mass spectra of peptides obtained from the cross-linked proteins digested in O-18 water, the through-space cross-linked peptides were distinguished by a characteristic 8 Da mass shift, whereas the non-modified, internally cross-linked or end-capped peptides showed a 4 Da mass shift. The mass shifts rely on the complete incorporation of two O-18 atoms during proteolytic hydrolysis for each C-terminus ending with either lysine or arginine .
In this study, we probe the conformation of BSA by mass spectrometry, combined with lysine-specific cross-linking and tryptic digestion. To generate information about the distance constraints for BSA, which contains 60 lysines as well as many hydrophobic pockets, we used three different lysine-specific cross-linkers of varying spacer arm lengths and hydrophobicity (Figure 1). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, (BS3), a water-soluble chemical cross-linker with a spacer arm length of 11.4 Å, was chosen to generate information of the lysine–lysine distance constraints for the lysines in the hydrophilic or surface regions. Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), a water-insoluble analog of BS3 whose reactivity and spacer arm length are virtually identical to BS3 , was used in an attempt to generate the cross-linking information for the lysines in the hydrophobic regions. In addition, we used disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), a hydrophobic cross-linker with a shorter spacer arm length (7.7 Å), to further refine the distance constraints between lysine residues in the BSA molecule. Each cross-linked peptide was recognized with the aid of O-18 labeling and characterized by the MS/MS analysis. The distance constraints obtained from the cross-linked lysine residues in BSA were compared with the distance between the corresponding lysine residues in HSA from the crystal structure, wherever such comparison was feasible.
Fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3), disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), and disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Modified trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). O-18 enriched water (99%) was purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). Potassium phosphate was purchased from Mallinckrodt (Phillipsburg, NJ). Pure water was obtained from a Milli-Q UV plus ultra-pure water system (Bedford, MA). Other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
BSA at 10 μM in phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) was incubated with 500 μM cross-linkers (prepared freshly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions) at room temperature for 30 min. This condition represents a cross-linker to protein ratio of 50:1. We have also used a cross-linker to protein ratio of 20:1, which is supposed to generate only one cross-linking per molecule [24], and found virtually identical results. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra for the BSA molecules cross-linked under our experimental condition was also identical to that of the non-cross-linked control (data not shown), indicating that no major conformational changes occurred due to cross-linking. The reaction was quenched with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The protein was reduced with dithiothreitol (100 mM) for 1 h at 56 °C and alkylated with iodoacetamide (100 mM) for 45 min at room temperature. The sample mixture was dialyzed against pure water using a membrane with MW cutoff of 3500 Da (Waters) three times within 24 h. The sample was divided into two equal aliquots which were dried using a vacuum centrifuge. As described by Back , the samples were reconstituted in either pure water or 99% O-18 enriched water containing 5% ACN. The reconstituted mixture was subjected to tryptic digestion at 37 °C for 20 h with a trypsin to protein ratio of 1:10. Alternatively, after reduction and alkylation, SDS/PAGE was carried out to isolate the intramolecular-crosslinked monomer from the intermolecular-crosslinked multimers. The monomer was subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. Under our experimental conditions, the multimeric bands were not observed after visualization with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.
After desalting using a C18 ZipTip (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), the tryptic peptides were analyzed by a QSTAR pulsar Qq-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Toronto, CA) equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source. The ion source voltage was set at 1100 V in the positive ion mode. A full mass spectrum was acquired over an m/z range of 500–2000, and the ions of interest were subjected to collision-induced dissociation using high purity argon for MS/MS analysis.
LC-nano-ESI MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD Trap XCT mass spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA) equipped with an Agilent 1100 nanoflow LC system. Peptides were separated using a Zorbax 300 SB C18 column (75 μm × 150 mm, 3.5 μm, Agilent, Wilmington, DE) using a mobile phase that contained Solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and Solvent B (0.1% formic acid in ACN) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mobile phase composition was held initially at 2% B for 3 min and then changed from 2–80% B over 80 min. A capillary voltage was set at 1600 V. The mass spectrometer was scanned from 300 to 2000 m/z range.
The mass values of tryptic peptides were assigned with the help of the Protein Analysis Work Sheet (PAWS) (ProteoMetrics, NY). The cross-linked tryptic peptide peaks were distinguished by the comparison of the mass spectra obtained from the digests of the non-cross-linked control or cross-linked BSA. The through-space cross-linked peptide peaks were confirmed by the characteristic 8 Da mass shift when digested in O-18 water. The identity of the cross-linked peptides was revealed through the amino acid sequence information obtained using the MS/MS analysis.
The 3-D structure of BSA is believed to be very similar to HSA, because the two proteins share 76% sequence identity. Figure 2a shows the crystal structure of HSA and the amino acid sequences of BSA and HSA. The heart-shaped HSA molecule is made up of three homologous α-helical domains (I, II, III) . Each domain contains two subdomains (A and B) that share common structure motifs. Each domain can be divided into 10 helical segments: for example, h1–h6 for the Subdomain A and h7–h10 for the Subdomain B (Figure 2b). Human serum albumin structure is predominantly α-helical (67%) with the remaining polypeptide occurring in turns and extended or flexible regions between subdomains, and contains no β-sheets . The subdomain information is indicated along with the amino acid sequences of BSA and HSA. The distance constraints between lysine residues in BSA obtained in the present study was compared with the distances of the corresponding lysine residues of HSA determined by the crystal structure, if such corresponding residues are present.
As shown in Figure 3, the cross-linked peptides can be identified by comparing the mass spectra of tryptic digests obtained from unmodified (3a) and BS3-modified BSA (3b,c). The newly emerging peptide peaks in the spectra from BS3-modified BSA digested with trypsin in O-16 water (3b) or 99% O-18 water (3c) revealed the nature of the cross-linking. With the digestion in O-18 water, the characteristic mass shifts of 8 Da confirmed the through-space cross-linking peptides, whereas the cross-linked peptides within one segment or peptides end-capped with the cross-linker showed 4 Da shift. An example is shown in Figure 3b for a representative through-space cross-linked peptide with a mass value of 2952.5, which was reconstructed from a triply charged ion at m/z 985.2 (inset). In the spectrum of BS3-modified BSA digested in O-18 water (Figure 3c), the corresponding peak appeared at a mass of 2960.5 which was derived from the triply charged ion detected at m/z 987.9. The 8 Da difference in the mass indicated that this peak resulted from through-space cross-linking.
The identity of the cross-linked peptides detected as the triply charged ion at m/z 985.2 was determined by the amino acid sequence analyzed by MS/MS, as shown in Figure 4. Clearly, the data revealed that this peak resulted from the through-space cross-linking between the segments A[233–241]R, and L[372–386]K, with K235 from the Subdomain IIA cross-linked to K374 from the Subdomain IIB. Good coverage of y-series ions was observed for both segments. The amide bond cleavages due to the fragmentation of A[233–241]R are labeled with lower case letters, whereas those from L[372–386]K are marked with upper case letters. O-18 labeling during tryptic digestion assisted in distinguishing the C-terminal ions from the N-terminal ions. The y ions from O-18 labeled peptides showed a mass shift of 4 Da in comparison to the corresponding y ions, because these ions contained a single C-terminus. In contrast, b ions were not affected by O-18 labeling as shown for B3 or b3 at m/z 451 as an example. The B3 or b3 ion in this case included C8H12O2 of BS3 with a net mass increase of 138 considering the loss of two hydrogen atoms from the lysine side chains upon cross-linking.
In some cases, LC/MS/MS analyses allowed more reliable identification of cross-linked peptides as the separation of the tryptic peptide mixture precedes the mass spectrometric detection. Figure 5 depicts a typical extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) reconstructed for a cross-linked peptide with a molecular weight of 1974 Da. The peptide was detected as triply and quadruply charged ions at m/z 659.0 and 494.5, respectively, as shown in the inset of Figure 5b, and therefore, these two ions were used to reconstruct the ion chromatogram. This chromatographic peak eluting at 27.8 min was observed in the digests of the BS3-modified BSA, and as expected, was not present in the digest from the unmodified control BSA (Figure 5a). The corresponding chromatographic peak for the O-18 labeled peptides contained the triply charged ion at m/z 661.7 and quadruply charged ion at m/z 496.5, representing a through-space cross-linked peptide with the molecular weight of 1982 (Figure 5c).
Figure 6 shows the MS/MS spectra for the triply charged ions at m/z 659.0 and 661.7 derived from O-16 and O-18 labeled digests. The fragments detected in the spectra revealed that this peptide resulted from the cross-linking between the segments E[210–218]R and L[242–248]K, with K211 (located in the turn between Subdomain IB and Subdomain IIA) linked to K245 (from Subdomain IIA). The assignment of each fragment was assisted by O-18 labeling. For example, the fragment ion at m/z 1080.6 appeared in both O-16 and O-18 labeled peptide spectra, indicating that it belonged to the N-terminal ions. The singly charged ion of m/z 1225.5 increased 4 mass units in the O-18 trace, implying that this ion contained only one C-terminus. The doubly charged fragment ion of 923.0 shifted to 927.0 for the O-18 labeled peptide, reflecting a mass shift of 8 Da. Therefore, this ion was readily identified as a y-series ion containing both C-termini of the cross-linked segments. For the fragment ions containing both segments the loss of NH3 was commonly observed as shown for y9Y4, y9Y5, y9Y6, b2Y7, and b3Y7 ions. The ion y9Y4 represented the fragment containing y9 from the peptide segment of E[210–218]R and Y4 of the segment L[242–248]K plus C8H12O2 of BS3 (net mass increase of 138). According to the above information, the fragment ions detected in the MS/MS spectra of all the cross-linked peptides were unambiguously assigned. A summary of all the cross-linked and end-capped peptides detected by LC/MS and Qq-TOF is presented in Table 1. Nine through space and four internally cross-linked peptides as well as two end-capped peptides were identified and characterized. The table also lists the distances between the corresponding lysine residues from the crystal structure of HSA molecule as a comparison for the distance constraints obtained in this study.
Figure 7 depicts representative reconstructed mass spectra of tryptic digests obtained from unmodified control (7a), DSS (7b, c) or DSG-modified BSA (7d, e). The cross-linked BSA was digested in either O-16 or O-18 water. The newly formed cross-linked peptides were identified by Qq-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the digests from the DSS-modified or DSG-modified BSA. An example is shown for a peak with a mass of 3251.5 reconstructed from the quadruply charged ion of m/z 813.9 (inset b), which appeared in the mass spectrum of DSS-modified BSA digested with trypsin in O-16 water. Its mass shifted to 3259.6 (reconstructed from 815.9, inset c) in the corresponding O-18 spectrum, indicating a through-space cross-linking. In the mass spectrum of DSG-modified BSA digested in O-16 water, a new peak with mass of 3209.7 (reconstructed from the quadruply charged ion of m/z 803.4, inset d) was observed. The peak showed an increase of 8 Da in mass (3217.6 Da, reconstructed from 805.4, inset,e) in the corresponding O-18 spectrum. The MS/MS spectrum of the peak with the mass of 3251.5 or 3259.6 (O-16 or O-18) was essentially the same as that from the peak with the mass of 3209.7 or 3217.6 (O-16 or O-18) shown in Figure 8. The MS/MS analyses revealed that the peaks originated from the cross-linking between K235 in helix 2, and K263 of helix 3 in the Subdomain IIA, via C8H12O2 of DSS (net mass increase of 138) or C5H6O2 of DSG (net mass increase of 96), respectively. The LC-MS/MS results were consistent with the data obtained from static nanospray ionization/Qq-TOF analysis. Tables 2 and 3 list all cross-linked and capped peptides that were modified by DSS and DSG, respectively. Using DSS, 12 through-space and 5 internally cross-linked peptides, and 1 end-capped cross-linked peptide were identified. With DSG, 8 through-space and 4 internally cross-linked peptides, and 1 end-capped cross-linked peptide were detected.
The cross-linking with BS3 (Table 1) generated three short-span internal cross-linked peptides, which are within 7 amino acids in a segment (K138–K140, K156–K160, and K399–K401). These peptides were of little value in providing the 3-D spatial constraints, because BS3 coupling with two lysines could span up to 7 amino acids . The remaining long-span internal cross-linking between K412 and K420 of the Subdomain IIIA, as well as the 9 through-space lysine cross-linking, should provide valuable information on the distance constraints in the 3-D structure of BSA. Six inter-domain cross-linked pairs (K140 of IA to K455 of IIIA, K228 of IIA to K489 of IIIA, K204 of IB/IIA to K495 of IIIA, K211 of IB/IIA to K463 of IIIA, K245 of IIA and K463 of IIIA, K211 of IB/IIA to K245 of IIA), 2 inter-subdomain cross-linked pairs (K437 of IIIA to K561 of IIIB, K235 of IIA to K374 of IIB), as well as 2 intra-subdomain cross-linked peptides (K412 to K420 within IIIA, K455 to K463 within IIIA) were found.
Modification of BSA with DSS generated 17 cross-linked lysine pairs (Table 2). Of these, 11 pairs including K140–K455, K437–K561, K235–K374, K228–K489, K204–K495, K211–K463, K245–K463, K455–K463, K211–245, K412–420, and K138–K140, were seen in the BS3-modified BSA. However, three through-space cross-linked pairs including K235–K266, K235–K263, and K548–K559, along with a long-span internally cross-linked pair K88–K100, and two short-span internally cross-linked pairs, K263–K266, and K495–K498, were observed only in the DSS-modified BSA. In contrast, the internally cross-linked pairs K399–K401 and K156–K160 were observed only with the BS3-modified BSA.
When hydrophobic cross-linkers were used, 5% DMSO was included in the reaction mixture. However, DMSO had no influence on the integrity of the BSA conformation, as cross-linking of BSA with BS3 in the presence or absence of 5% DMSO generated virtually the same results (data not shown). One plausible explanation for the additional cross-linked pairs using DSS is that some lysine residues may not be accessible to the cross-linker BS3 due to hydrophobicity of the surrounding environments. For example, K100 is surrounded by the hydrophobic residues, including leucine, cysteine, valine, and alanine, and thus is more accessible to hydrophobic cross-linker DSS but not to BS3. This view is corroborated with the observation that the cross-linking between K88 and K100 was found only with hydrophobic cross-linker DSS and not with BS3, even though end-capping at K88 was observed with both cross-linkers. Similarly, K498 is located in the hydrophobic pockets in the IIIA domain, surrounded by cysteines. Also, K548 and K559 are located in the hydrophobic cavity of the IIIB domain; K263 and K266 are also located in the hydrophobic region in IIA . These lysine residues in the hydrophobic regions may not be accessible to BS3, and therefore, were not cross-linked when a water soluble BS3 was used as a cross-linker. In contrast, K156 or K160 might be easily accessible to BS3 but not to DSS, due to the influence of the nearby hydroxyl group of Y161 . As a consequence, the cross-linking of K156–K160 occurred only when BS3 was used. Likewise, K399 and K401, modified only with BS3 (Table 1), may be spatially surrounded with polar side chains, preventing the penetration of the hydrophobic cross-linkers to these lysine residues.
The lysines that are located at the interfaces between helices or turns between domains, including K138 and K140 (interface between h6 and h7 of IA); K489 (interface between h4–h5 of IIIA); K228 (right before the interface between h1 and h2 of IIA); K204 and K211 (turn between IB and IIA); K495 (near interface between h4 and h5 of IIIA); K463 (interface between h3 and h4 of IIIA); K412 (turn between IIB and IIIA), K420 (interface between h1 and h2 of IIIA); K561 (interface between h8 and h9 of IIIB); K437(near the interface between h2 and h3 of IIIA); K88 (interface between h3 and h4 of IA); K245 (near the interface between h2 and h3 of IIA), are exposed to the surface, and therefore, accessible to both water-soluble BS3 and hydrophobic DSS, for cross-linking reactions, as evidenced by most of the common cross-linked pairs. Considering the length of flexible lysine side chains, the maximum span allowed by the cross-linking with DSS or BS3 is approximately 24 Å . Therefore, the distance between the cross-linked lysine pairs should be within 24 Å.
The spacer arm length of DSG is 7.7 Å, which is shorter than that of DSS or BS3 (11.4 Å) by 3.7 Å. Accordingly, the maximum distance between lysine pairs cross-linked with DSG would be approximately 20 Å. Of the 17 cross-linked pairs found in DSS- modified BSA, only 12 were identified using DSG. This information further refined the distance constraint for these 12 lysine pairs to approximately 20 Å (Table 3). However, the remaining five cross-linked pairs, including K140–K455, K235–K374, K245–K463, K211–K245, and K412–420, were not found, implying that the K–K distances for these lysine pairs are greater than 20 Å but less than 24 Å.
Of the total 19 cross-linked lysine pairs observed with BSA, only 6 homologous pairs can be found in the HSA crystal structure (PDB entry 1ao6). The K–K distances of these pairs were obtained using Protein Explorer (version 1.982) (Tables 1–3). The distance constraints obtained in this study are consistent with the HSA crystal structure with the exception of K235-K374. The distance between K235 and K374 in BSA is expected to be between 20 and 24 Å, based on the fact that they were cross-linked with DSS but not with DSG. However, the distance between the corresponding lysine residues K236 and K375 in HSA is 13.4 Å, suggesting that the 3-D structure of BSA may deviate from that of HSA in this region. The information on the distance constraints obtained from the cross-linked lysine residues, particularly for which homologous lysines were not found in HSA, should be valuable in assisting the characterization of BSA conformation.
We have used mass spectrometric analysis coupled with chemical cross-linking to probe the 3-D structure of BSA. Because BSA contains 60 lysines, lysine specific cross-linkers were employed. Considering that many lysine residues exist in the hydrophobic regions, the hydrophobic cross-linkers DSS and DSG, as well as the water-soluble cross-linker, BS3, were used to obtain complementary information. The through-space cross-linked peptides were identified rapidly with the assistance of O-18 labeling during digestion with trypsin. The O-18 labeling also assisted in the interpretation of MS/MS spectra of the cross-linked peptides by distinguishing the C-terminal ions from N-terminal ions. Each cross-linked peptide was characterized by MS/MS for unambiguous assignment. The distance constraints were obtained from 12 through-space and 7 internally cross-linked lysine pairs identified in this study. Our data indicated that the distance between K140 of IA and K455 of IIIA, K235 of IIA and K374 of IIB, K245 of IIA and K463 of IIIA, K211 of IB/IIA and K245 of IIA, and K412 and 420 of IIIA, is between 20 and 24 Å. The distance constraints for 12 lysine pairs including K235–K266, K437–K561, K228–K489, K204–K495, K211–K463, K235–K263, K455–K463, K548–K559, K88–K100, K263–K266, K138–K140, and K495–K498, were found to be approximately 20 Å. The distance constraints obtained in this study also suggested that K235 and K374 are farther away from each other in BSA molecule in comparison to the corresponding lysine residues in HSA. We have demonstrated in this study that chemical cross-linking with mass spectrometric detection can be employed to readily generate the 3-D information of BSA. With proper choice of cross-linking criteria, for example, using multiple cross-linkers with different span lengths and chemistry, comprehensive information about the tertiary structure can be obtained for proteins of interest.
