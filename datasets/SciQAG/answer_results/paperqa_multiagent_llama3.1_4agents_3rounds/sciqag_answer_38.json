    "question": "How does the selectivity coefficient of the MIP based ISE towards discriminated ions compare to that of the NIP membrane electrode?",
    "ground_truth": "The proposed MIP membrane electrode shows high selectivity to melamine ion over other cations such as Na+, K+, H+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. The selectivity coefficients of the MIP based ISE are superior to those of the NIP membrane electrode due to the specific recognition of the MIP for the target ion.",
    "system_answer": "The selectivity coefficient of the MIP-based ISE towards discriminated ions is superior to that of the NIP membrane electrode. This is because molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) can be designed to selectively recognize and respond to specific target ions, resulting in improved selectivity compared to non-imprinted polymer (NIP) membranes."
