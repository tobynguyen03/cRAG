    "question": "What were the key findings regarding glucose metabolism in the study?",
    "ground_truth": "The study found that in diabetes, glucose excretion was enormous, being nearly 7500-fold higher than in control rats. Other significantly enhanced metabolites included lactate, alanine, ethanol, and fumarate. These findings suggest that glucose metabolism is dramatically perturbed in diabetes.",
    "system_answer": "Diabetic rats exhibit impaired glucose metabolism with:\n\n* Elevated plasma glucose levels\n* Increased breakdown of glycogen and gluconeogenesis\n* Enhanced endogenous glucose production (EGP) fueled by amino acids\n* Increased alanine and urea levels\n* Altered correlations between metabolites."
