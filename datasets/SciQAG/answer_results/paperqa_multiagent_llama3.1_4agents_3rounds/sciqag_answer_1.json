    "question": "What is Type 1 diabetes and what causes it?",
    "ground_truth": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that results from the selective destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Genetics, environmental factors, nutritional effects, and a combination of these are believed to be associated with the disease. Streptozotocin (STZ) is commonly used to induce diabetes mellitus in experimental studies.",
    "system_answer": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to early-stage insulin deficiency and later stage gluconeogenesis fueled by amino acids or dietary ingestion. Causes are linked to genetics, environmental factors, nutritional effects, or a combination of these."
