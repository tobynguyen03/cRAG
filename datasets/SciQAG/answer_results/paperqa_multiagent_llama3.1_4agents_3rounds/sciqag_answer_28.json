    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards are essential in the analysis of phthalate esters. They correct for extraction efficiency, matrix effects, and instrumental variations to ensure accurate quantification by serving as a reference point against which sample concentrations can be calibrated."
