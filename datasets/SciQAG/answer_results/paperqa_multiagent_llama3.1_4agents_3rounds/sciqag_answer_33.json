    "question": "Why are MIPs considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts?",
    "ground_truth": "MIPs are considered stable because they are synthesized in the presence of functional monomers, template molecules, and a cross-linking agent. They are less costly because they require fewer steps and fewer reagents compared to the production of biological sensors such as antibodies and enzymes.",
    "system_answer": "MIPs (Molecularly Imprinted Polymers) are considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts because of a controlled synthesis process that replicates the binding site of the target molecule. This eliminates the need for complex biological processes or enzymes, resulting in a more efficient and cost-effective method."
