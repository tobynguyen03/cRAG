    "question": "What is the significance of the detection limit (DL) in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "The detection limit (DL) is a measure of the sensitivity of the analysis method. It is estimated using two different approaches, and in this study, the DL of analytes that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio of 3.",
    "system_answer": "The detection limit (DL) is a critical parameter in analytical chemistry that determines the minimum amount of an analyte (in this case, phthalate esters) that can be reliably detected. A low DL ensures food safety and protects human health by allowing for accurate and sensitive analysis of these toxic compounds."
