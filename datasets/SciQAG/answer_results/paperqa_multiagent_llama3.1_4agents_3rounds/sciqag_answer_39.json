    "question": "How promising is the flow analysis system based on the MIP based membrane electrode for the detection of melamine in milk?",
    "ground_truth": "The flow analysis system based on the MIP based membrane electrode is very promising for the detection of melamine in milk. The system, which includes sample pretreatment, takes less than 15 minutes and has a detection limit of 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121.",
    "system_answer": "The flow analysis system based on the MIP-based membrane electrode shows great promise for detecting melamine in milk. It offers improved linearity range and detection limit, along with high selectivity for melamine over other cations. This makes it a reliable tool for accurate melamine detection."
