    "question": "What is the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3?",
    "ground_truth": "The possible mechanism for the CL emission during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 is attributed to the oxidation processes of two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation.",
    "system_answer": "The likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 is the formation of vibrationally excited OH radicals, resulting from the oxidation of acetaldehyde and ethylene intermediates. This process leads to the emission of light."
