    "question": "How is the CL intensity of the SrCO3 sensor related to the concentration of ethanol vapor?",
    "ground_truth": "The CL intensity of the SrCO3 sensor increases with the increase in the concentration of ethanol vapor. A calibration curve of CL intensity versus ethanol vapor concentration was created and was found to be linear in the tested range.",
    "system_answer": "The CL intensity of the SrCO3 sensor is linearly related to the concentration of ethanol vapor, with a detection limit of 2.1 ppm and a range of 6-3750 ppm, described by the equation lg I = 1.07 \u00d7 lg C + 1.37 (r = 0.998, n = 8)."
