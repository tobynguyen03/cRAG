    "question": "How does the extraction temperature affect the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre?",
    "ground_truth": "To accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase their concentration in the headspace, a high extraction temperature is desirable. However, a high extraction temperature also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for lighter esters such as DMP and DEP.",
    "system_answer": "The extraction temperature influences the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre by affecting the extraction of phthalate esters based on their molecular weight. Higher temperatures increase the extraction of heavier esters while decreasing that of lighter esters."
