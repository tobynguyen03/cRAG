    "question": "How was the method detection limit (MDL) calculated in this study?",
    "ground_truth": "The method detection limit (MDL) was calculated by dividing the detection limit by the absolute extraction efficiency. The MDLs of this method were in general lower than those previously reported, which makes this method more sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "The method detection limit (MDL) was calculated by dividing the detection limit (DL) by the absolute extraction efficiency (AEE). The AEE varied depending on the fat content. This calculation provides an accurate measurement of the MDL in the study."
