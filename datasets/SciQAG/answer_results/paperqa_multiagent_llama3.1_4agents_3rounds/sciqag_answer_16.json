    "question": "How long can the SrCO3 sensor endure in a continuous ethanol vapor introduction experiment?",
    "ground_truth": "The SrCO3 sensor showed no obvious change after 100 hours of reaction to continuous introduction of 2000 ppm ethanol vapor. The sensor kept the same response to ethanol vapor over the 100 hour period.",
    "system_answer": "The SrCO3 sensor can endure in a continuous ethanol vapor introduction experiment for at least 100 hours, demonstrating stability and durability over this timeframe."
