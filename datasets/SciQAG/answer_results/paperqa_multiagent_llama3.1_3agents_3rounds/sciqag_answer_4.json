    "question": "What were the key findings regarding glucose metabolism in the study?",
    "ground_truth": "The study found that in diabetes, glucose excretion was enormous, being nearly 7500-fold higher than in control rats. Other significantly enhanced metabolites included lactate, alanine, ethanol, and fumarate. These findings suggest that glucose metabolism is dramatically perturbed in diabetes.",
    "system_answer": "The key findings regarding glucose metabolism are:\n\n* Increased plasma glucose levels\n* Impaired glucose metabolism\n* Enhanced endogenous glucose production (EGP)\n* Altered metabolite correlations\n\nThese findings indicate disrupted glucose regulation in the subjects studied."
