    "question": "What is the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3?",
    "ground_truth": "The possible mechanism for the CL emission during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 is attributed to the oxidation processes of two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation.",
    "system_answer": "The likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 involves the oxidation of ethylene and acetaldehyde. These intermediates are produced as a result of ethanol decomposition, leading to chemiluminescence (CL) emissions."
