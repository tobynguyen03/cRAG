    "question": "How does the extraction temperature affect the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre?",
    "ground_truth": "To accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase their concentration in the headspace, a high extraction temperature is desirable. However, a high extraction temperature also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for lighter esters such as DMP and DEP.",
    "system_answer": "The extraction temperature affects SPME fibre efficiency non-linearly. Higher temperatures improve extraction efficiency for heavier phthalate esters, while decreasing it for lighter esters. This relationship varies depending on the type of ester present."
