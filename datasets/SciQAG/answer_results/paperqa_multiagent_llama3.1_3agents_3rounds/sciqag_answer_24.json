    "question": "What is the advantage of the headspace approach in SPME?",
    "ground_truth": "The headspace approach in SPME is advantageous because it eliminates the co-extraction of undissolved particles and non-volatile components in the sample matrix. This approach could be particularly useful in selectingively extracting phthalate esters because the fibre is not directly submerged in the matrix.",
    "system_answer": "The headspace approach in Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME) is advantageous because it increases analyte concentration at high temperatures, reducing interference from biological components, and eliminates solvent-consuming cleaning procedures, resulting in increased sensitivity and accuracy."
