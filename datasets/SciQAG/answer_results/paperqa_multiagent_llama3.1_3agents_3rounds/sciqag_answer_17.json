    "question": "What is the importance of temperature in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor?",
    "ground_truth": "Temperature plays a significant role in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor. The CL signal increases with the increase in temperature, indicating that the catalytic oxidation process that produces the luminescent intermediates is under a diffusion controlled condition at flow rate below a certain temperature, and is under a reaction controlled condition at flow rate above that temperature.",
    "system_answer": "Temperature plays a critical role in the chemiluminescence (CL) emission process of the SrCO3 sensor. Optimal performance is achieved at 380 \u00b0C, where there is a balance between CL intensity and noise signal, ensuring accurate results."
