    "question": "What is the significance of nanosized materials in the development of chemical sensors?",
    "ground_truth": "Nanosized materials have special features that differ from bulk materials, making them ideal for chemical sensing. They exhibit high activity, good selectivity and are small in size, which makes them perfect for chemical sensors.",
    "system_answer": "Nanosized materials are significant in developing chemical sensors due to their unique features, such as high reactivity, allowing them to detect small concentrations of gas molecules, making them highly sensitive and selective."
