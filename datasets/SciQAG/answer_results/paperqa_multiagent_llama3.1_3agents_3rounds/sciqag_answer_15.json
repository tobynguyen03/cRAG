    "question": "How selective is the SrCO3 sensor for detecting ethanol among other gases?",
    "ground_truth": "The SrCO3 sensor exhibits a significantly high selectivity to ethanol. The sensor was not responsive to the passage of other gases such as gasoline, ammonia, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen under the optimized conditions.",
    "system_answer": "The SrCO3 sensor exhibits high selectivity when detecting ethanol compared to other gases. Its specific reaction mechanism and sensitivity profile contribute to this selectivity, with minimal interference from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen."
