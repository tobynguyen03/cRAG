    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards are used to correct for extraction efficiency and matrix effects, ensuring accurate quantification of phthalate esters. They account for variations in sample composition, such as fat content in milk samples, allowing for precise analysis."
