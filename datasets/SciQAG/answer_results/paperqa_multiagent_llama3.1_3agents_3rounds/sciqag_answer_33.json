    "question": "Why are MIPs considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts?",
    "ground_truth": "MIPs are considered stable because they are synthesized in the presence of functional monomers, template molecules, and a cross-linking agent. They are less costly because they require fewer steps and fewer reagents compared to the production of biological sensors such as antibodies and enzymes.",
    "system_answer": "MIPs (Molecularly Imprinted Polymers) are considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce because of their well-defined chemical structures, scalability, and lower production costs. They also exhibit predetermined selectivity, allowing them to avoid the use of expensive enzymes or antibodies. This makes them an attractive alternative to biological counterparts."
