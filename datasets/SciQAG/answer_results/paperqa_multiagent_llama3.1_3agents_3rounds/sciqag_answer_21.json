    "question": "What are the potential health impacts of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Phthalate esters, which are widely used as additives in the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, have endocrine disrupting properties. Studies have shown that they can be estrogenic and have reproductive effects in mammals. The European Commission is proposing a ban on the use of phthalate esters in soft PVC materials for making baby toys due to these potential health impacts.",
    "system_answer": "Phthalate esters have been linked to reproductive issues, cancer, and endocrine disruption. Animal studies show negative effects on human health through bioaccumulation or toxicity concerns, suggesting potential harm from exposure to these chemicals."
