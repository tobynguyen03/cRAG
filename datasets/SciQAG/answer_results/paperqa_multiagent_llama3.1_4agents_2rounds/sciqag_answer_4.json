    "question": "What were the key findings regarding glucose metabolism in the study?",
    "ground_truth": "The study found that in diabetes, glucose excretion was enormous, being nearly 7500-fold higher than in control rats. Other significantly enhanced metabolites included lactate, alanine, ethanol, and fumarate. These findings suggest that glucose metabolism is dramatically perturbed in diabetes.",
    "system_answer": "Diabetic rats exhibit significant changes in glucose levels and glycolysis. Gluconeogenesis, fueled by amino acids from protein degradation or dietary intake, is a key factor in endogenous glucose production. The TCA cycle is disrupted, and correlations between metabolites are decreased compared to controls. Elevated plasma glucose and lactate/pyruvate levels also occur due to increased glycolysis."
