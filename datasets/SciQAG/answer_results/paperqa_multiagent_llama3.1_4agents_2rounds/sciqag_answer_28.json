    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards play a crucial role in phthalate ester analysis. They serve as references for measurement, correcting extraction efficiency and enabling concentration calculation using one-point standard addition methods. Additionally, internal standards validate peak identity and integration, ensuring accuracy and precision in results."
