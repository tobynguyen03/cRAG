    "question": "How can the potential response of the MIP based membrane ISE be characterized?",
    "ground_truth": "The potential response of the MIP based membrane ISE can be characterized as rapid, fully reversible, and exhibiting a near-Nernstian response in the concentration range of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121. It also has a low detection limit and wide linearity range.",
    "system_answer": "The potential response of the MIP-based membrane ISE can be characterized by measuring its potentiometric properties, testing pH effects, comparing response slope with a standard calibration curve, evaluating selectivity coefficients towards interfering ions, analyzing sensitivity and linearity for the membrane electrode, and investigating the influence of K+ and Na+."
