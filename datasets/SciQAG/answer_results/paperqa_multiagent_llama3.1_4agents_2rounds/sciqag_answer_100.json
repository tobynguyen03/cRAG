    "question": "How were the derivatives of aniline detected in this study?",
    "ground_truth": "The derivatives of aniline were detected using Gas Chromatography-ElectronCapture Detection (GC-ECD). After simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, a small sample of the sedimented phase was injected to GC\u2013MS for analysis.",
    "system_answer": "The derivatives of aniline were detected using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) after extraction with Dispersive Liquid-Liquid Microextraction (DLLME), involving simultaneous extraction and derivatization under optimized conditions."
