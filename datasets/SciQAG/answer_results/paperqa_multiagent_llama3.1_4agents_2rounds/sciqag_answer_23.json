    "question": "What is the drawback of using solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis?",
    "ground_truth": "The use of solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis can present a drawback as residues of the solvent, especially DEHP, can also be found in the solvent. Moreover, fat in dairy product samples such as milk could be co-extracted and require extra steps to remove them prior to phthalate analysis, which makes the direct SPME method inappropriate for complex matrices such as milk and other dairy products.",
    "system_answer": "The primary drawback of using solvents in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis is contamination with phthalate esters themselves, particularly DEHP, which can lead to inaccurate results. Additionally, solvents often require extra steps to remove co-extracted fat, complicating the process."
