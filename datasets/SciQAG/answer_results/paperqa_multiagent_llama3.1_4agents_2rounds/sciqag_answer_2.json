    "question": "What is the role of metabolomics in healthcare?",
    "ground_truth": "Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations, providing a wealth of biological information on complex systems. It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and inborn errors of metabolism. It uses advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers and biological networks.",
    "system_answer": "Metabolomics plays a critical role in healthcare by analyzing endogenous metabolites. This helps to:\n\n* Detect and describe biological endpoint effects\n* Predict toxicity\n* Identify biomarkers for diseases\n* Understand disease mechanisms\n* Provide insights into physiological processes\n\nThis analysis enables personalized medicine, improved treatment outcomes, and enhanced understanding of disease progression."
