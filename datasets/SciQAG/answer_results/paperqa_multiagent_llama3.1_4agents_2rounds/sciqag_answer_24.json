    "question": "What is the advantage of the headspace approach in SPME?",
    "ground_truth": "The headspace approach in SPME is advantageous because it eliminates the co-extraction of undissolved particles and non-volatile components in the sample matrix. This approach could be particularly useful in selectingively extracting phthalate esters because the fibre is not directly submerged in the matrix.",
    "system_answer": "The headspace approach in Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) offers several advantages. It allows for the extraction of analytes from the gas phase above the sample, reducing interference and increasing concentration. Additionally, it eliminates matrix effects, enabling efficient extraction of semi-volatile organic chemicals at lower temperatures. This approach is particularly useful in samples with high fat content, such as milk, where it facilitates the extraction of phthalate esters."
