    "question": "How was the diabetic rat model established in this study?",
    "ground_truth": "In this study, female rats were divided into a diabetic group and a control group. The diabetic group received an intraperitoneal dose of STZ, and showed glucose levels in the blood of more than 200 mg/dl after 4 days. The control group was matched for age and gender, and did not receive the STZ injection.",
    "system_answer": "The diabetic rat model was established through STZ (Streptozotocin) administration, inducing hyperglycemia and diabetes-like symptoms in the rats. This method is widely used to study diabetes due to its ability to mimic human diabetes effectively."
