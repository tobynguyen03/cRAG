    "question": "What is the drawback of using solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis?",
    "ground_truth": "The use of solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis can present a drawback as residues of the solvent, especially DEHP, can also be found in the solvent. Moreover, fat in dairy product samples such as milk could be co-extracted and require extra steps to remove them prior to phthalate analysis, which makes the direct SPME method inappropriate for complex matrices such as milk and other dairy products.",
    "system_answer": "The use of solvents in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis has several drawbacks. Key issues include:\n\n- Interference with extraction: Solvent residues can co-elute with the target analytes, leading to inaccurate results.\n- Volatility of analytes: Phthalate esters are relatively volatile compounds that may be lost during solvent evaporation or other drying steps.\n- Non-specificity and matrix effects: Solvents can interact with non-target compounds in the sample, causing false positives.\n\nThis limitation highlights the need for careful selection of solvents, method development, and quality control measures to ensure accurate analysis."
