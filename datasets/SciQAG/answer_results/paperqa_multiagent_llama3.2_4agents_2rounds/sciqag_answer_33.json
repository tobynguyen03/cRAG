    "question": "Why are MIPs considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts?",
    "ground_truth": "MIPs are considered stable because they are synthesized in the presence of functional monomers, template molecules, and a cross-linking agent. They are less costly because they require fewer steps and fewer reagents compared to the production of biological sensors such as antibodies and enzymes.",
    "system_answer": "Molecularly Imprinted Particles (MIPs) are considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts due to advancements in recombinant DNA technology. This technology enables controlled synthesis and processing, allowing for precise replication of target molecules. The result is a scalable, cost-effective method for producing uniform MIPs with improved stability and consistency."
