    "question": "What is the role of the ion-exchanger resin columns in the detection of melamine?",
    "ground_truth": "Ion-exchanger resin columns are used to eliminate the interference of anion and cation co-existing in milk samples. They are particularly effective at removing high concentrations of ions such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+ that are present in milk.",
    "system_answer": "### Synthesized Answer:\n\nIon-exchanger resin columns play a crucial role in detecting melamine by removing negatively charged interfering ions (Na+ and K+) from milk samples. This enhancement improves the detection limit and linearity range of melamine concentration measurements, leading to more accurate results.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n* All expert inputs highlight the removal of interfering ions as a key function.\n* Agents 0, 1, and 2 agree on using an anion-exchanger column ahead of a cation-exchanger column in series setup.\n* Agent 3 emphasizes the selective removal of negatively charged interfering ions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe ion-exchanger resin columns are used to remove interfering ions, improving the accuracy of melamine detection. The use of an anion-exchanger column ahead of a cation-exchanger column in series setup is recommended for optimal results."
