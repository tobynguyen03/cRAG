    "question": "How is the possible CL emission process from the oxidation of C2H4 and CH3CHO on SrCO3 explained?",
    "ground_truth": "The CL phenomenon from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 can be attributed to the oxidation processes of the two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation, C2H4 and CH3CHO. The CL emission processes of these gases are likely different, with CH3CHO producing only acetaldehyde as an intermediate.",
    "system_answer": "### Synthesized Answer:\n\nThe possible CL emission process from the oxidation of C2H4 and CH3CHO on SrCO3 is attributed to the reaction of ethanol with SrCO3, forming formaldehyde (HCHO) and hydrogen peroxide. This reaction highlights the role of SrCO3 as a catalyst in facilitating the oxidation process."
