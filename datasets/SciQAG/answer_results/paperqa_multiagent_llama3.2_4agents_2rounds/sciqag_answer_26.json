    "question": "How does the extraction temperature affect the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre?",
    "ground_truth": "To accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase their concentration in the headspace, a high extraction temperature is desirable. However, a high extraction temperature also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for lighter esters such as DMP and DEP.",
    "system_answer": "The extraction temperature for a SPME fiber affects its efficiency in the optimal range of 60\u00b0C-90\u00b0C. Maximum efficiency is typically observed around 90\u00b0C, beyond which a plateau is reached. This range allows for effective sampling and binding of analytes to the fiber."
