    "question": "What is Type 1 diabetes and what causes it?",
    "ground_truth": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that results from the selective destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Genetics, environmental factors, nutritional effects, and a combination of these are believed to be associated with the disease. Streptozotocin (STZ) is commonly used to induce diabetes mellitus in experimental studies.",
    "system_answer": "Here's the synthesized answer:\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This results in insulin deficiency, as the body is unable to produce enough insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. Genetic and environmental factors may contribute to its development.\n\n(Note: I combined the key points from Agents 0-3 to create a concise answer that reflects their individual insights.)"
