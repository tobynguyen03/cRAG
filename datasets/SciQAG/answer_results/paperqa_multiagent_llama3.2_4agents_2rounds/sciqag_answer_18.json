    "question": "How is the CL intensity of the SrCO3 sensor related to the concentration of ethanol vapor?",
    "ground_truth": "The CL intensity of the SrCO3 sensor increases with the increase in the concentration of ethanol vapor. A calibration curve of CL intensity versus ethanol vapor concentration was created and was found to be linear in the tested range.",
    "system_answer": "The CL (chemiluminescence) intensity of the SrCO3 sensor is directly proportional to the concentration of ethanol vapor, indicating a linear relationship between the two. This means that as ethanol vapor concentration increases, the CL intensity also increases in a predictable and consistent manner."
