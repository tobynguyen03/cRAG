    "question": "How were the derivatives of aniline detected in this study?",
    "ground_truth": "The derivatives of aniline were detected using Gas Chromatography-ElectronCapture Detection (GC-ECD). After simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, a small sample of the sedimented phase was injected to GC\u2013MS for analysis.",
    "system_answer": "Derivatives of aniline were detected using GC-MS with PFBAY derivatization in pulse splitless mode. This method provides accurate and sensitive analysis of the target compounds, allowing for precise detection and quantification. The use of pulse splitless injection ensures efficient sample introduction into the instrument."
