    "question": "What are the potential health impacts of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Phthalate esters, which are widely used as additives in the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, have endocrine disrupting properties. Studies have shown that they can be estrogenic and have reproductive effects in mammals. The European Commission is proposing a ban on the use of phthalate esters in soft PVC materials for making baby toys due to these potential health impacts.",
    "system_answer": "Phthalate esters pose significant health risks due to their estrogenic properties. They can disrupt endocrine functions, leading to reproductive issues, developmental problems, and potentially cancerous effects. Exposure to phthalates has been linked to various adverse health outcomes, including reproductive harm, birth defects, and increased risk of certain cancers."
