    "question": "What is the advantage of the headspace approach in SPME?",
    "ground_truth": "The headspace approach in SPME is advantageous because it eliminates the co-extraction of undissolved particles and non-volatile components in the sample matrix. This approach could be particularly useful in selectingively extracting phthalate esters because the fibre is not directly submerged in the matrix.",
    "system_answer": "Here's a concise answer reflecting the best understanding of the topic:\n\nThe headspace approach in SPME (Solid Phase Microextraction) offers improved efficiency and reduced sample usage by extracting analytes from samples through vapor-phase extraction, particularly suitable for low-concentration analytes with low vapor pressure."
