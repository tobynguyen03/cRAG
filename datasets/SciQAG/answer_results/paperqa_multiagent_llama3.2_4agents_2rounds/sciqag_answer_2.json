    "question": "What is the role of metabolomics in healthcare?",
    "ground_truth": "Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations, providing a wealth of biological information on complex systems. It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and inborn errors of metabolism. It uses advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers and biological networks.",
    "system_answer": "Here's the synthesized answer:\n\nMetabolomics plays a vital role in healthcare as a diagnostic tool. It analyzes metabolic profiles to identify disturbances in metabolic pathways associated with diseases, aiding in understanding complex conditions. By predicting organ-specific effects and classifying samples, metabolomics aids in disease diagnosis and classification, providing valuable insights into the underlying causes of various health issues."
