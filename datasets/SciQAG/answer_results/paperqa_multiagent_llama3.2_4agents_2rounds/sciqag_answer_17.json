    "question": "What is the importance of temperature in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor?",
    "ground_truth": "Temperature plays a significant role in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor. The CL signal increases with the increase in temperature, indicating that the catalytic oxidation process that produces the luminescent intermediates is under a diffusion controlled condition at flow rate below a certain temperature, and is under a reaction controlled condition at flow rate above that temperature.",
    "system_answer": "### Synthesized Answer:\n\nTemperature is crucial for efficient gas sensing applications in the SrCO3 sensor. Optimal temperatures range from 350 to 470 \u00b0C, significantly impacting oxidation reactions and resulting in increased chemiluminescence (CL) intensity. Finding the right temperature range is essential for achieving accurate and reliable gas sensing results."
