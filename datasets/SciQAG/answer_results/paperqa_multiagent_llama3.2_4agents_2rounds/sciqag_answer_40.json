    "question": "How can the potential response of the MIP based membrane ISE be characterized?",
    "ground_truth": "The potential response of the MIP based membrane ISE can be characterized as rapid, fully reversible, and exhibiting a near-Nernstian response in the concentration range of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121. It also has a low detection limit and wide linearity range.",
    "system_answer": "The MIP-based membrane ISE's potential response can be characterized by measuring its potentiometric signal in response to varying melamine concentrations, with improvements such as incorporating lipophilic salts or ionic additives for increased sensitivity and selectivity."
