    "question": "How does the SrCO3 material used in the study respond to ethanol vapor?",
    "ground_truth": "The SrCO3 sensor responds to ethanol vapor with chemiluminescence (CL). The CL intensity increases sharply by about three orders of magnitude after ethanol vapor is introduced.",
    "system_answer": "The SrCO3 material exhibits significant chemiluminescence (CL) intensity increase in response to ethanol vapor, reporting a sharp and substantial three-order magnitude rise after introduction."
