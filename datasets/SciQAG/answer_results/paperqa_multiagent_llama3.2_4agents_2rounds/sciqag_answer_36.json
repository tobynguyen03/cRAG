    "question": "How does the sample pH affect the potential response of the MIP based melamine ISE?",
    "ground_truth": "The potential response of the MIP based melamine ISE is not constant at all pH levels. It tends to decrease at pHs beyond 4.5, probably because at higher pH values, melamine exists as a neutral molecule showing no potential response.",
    "system_answer": "The sample pH significantly impacts the MIP-based melamine ISE's potential response, with the most notable effect occurring within the pH range of 3.0 to 4.5. This optimal range allows for precise and stable measurements, ensuring accurate detection of melamine levels in samples."
