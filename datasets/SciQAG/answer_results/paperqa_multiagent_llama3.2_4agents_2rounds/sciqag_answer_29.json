    "question": "What is the significance of the detection limit (DL) in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "The detection limit (DL) is a measure of the sensitivity of the analysis method. It is estimated using two different approaches, and in this study, the DL of analytes that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio of 3.",
    "system_answer": "The detection limit (DL) is a crucial parameter in the analysis of phthalate esters. It represents the minimum amount of analyte that can be detected with confidence, typically 95%. A low DL indicates high sensitivity and accuracy in detecting phthalate esters, allowing for reliable quantification and assessment of environmental exposure or health risks associated with these chemicals."
