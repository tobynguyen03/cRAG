    "question": "How does the degree of cross-linking affect the potential response of the MIP based membrane electrode?",
    "ground_truth": "The degree of cross-linking is the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer during the polymerization process. A higher degree of cross-linking may result in difficulties in removing the template from the polymer and insolubility of MIP in the solvent. Therefore, a suitable degree of cross-linking must be achieved to form stable binding sites.",
    "system_answer": "The degree of cross-linking affects the potential response of the MIP-based membrane electrode by influencing its mechanical stability, selectivity, and sensitivity. The optimal degree of cross-linking is typically around 2.4 mmol to 3 mmol of EGDMA, resulting in improved selectivity and sensitivity."
