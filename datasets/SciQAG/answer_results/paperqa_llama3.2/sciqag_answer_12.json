    "question": "What is the significance of nanosized materials in the development of chemical sensors?",
    "ground_truth": "Nanosized materials have special features that differ from bulk materials, making them ideal for chemical sensing. They exhibit high activity, good selectivity and are small in size, which makes them perfect for chemical sensors.",
    "system_answer": "Nanosized materials are used in chemical sensors primarily to improve sensor performance by enhancing selectivity, sensitivity, and stability through their unique properties and high surface area-to-volume ratio."
