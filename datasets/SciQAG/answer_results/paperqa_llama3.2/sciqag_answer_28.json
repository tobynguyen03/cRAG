    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards are added to samples prior to analysis to facilitate accurate quantification of phthalate esters by compensating for variations in extraction efficiency or instrumental response."
