    "question": "What is the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3?",
    "ground_truth": "The possible mechanism for the CL emission during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 is attributed to the oxidation processes of two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation.",
    "system_answer": "The likely mechanism for CL emission during ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 is the reaction of ethanol with oxygen, forming acetaldehyde and then formaldehyde, supported by gas chromatography experiments."
