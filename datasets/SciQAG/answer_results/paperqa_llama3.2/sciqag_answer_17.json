    "question": "What is the importance of temperature in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor?",
    "ground_truth": "Temperature plays a significant role in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor. The CL signal increases with the increase in temperature, indicating that the catalytic oxidation process that produces the luminescent intermediates is under a diffusion controlled condition at flow rate below a certain temperature, and is under a reaction controlled condition at flow rate above that temperature.",
    "system_answer": "The optimal temperature for maximum sensitivity in the SrCO3 sensor is 380 \u00b0C due to its effect on enhancing the conversion of ethanol to ethylene and acetaldehyde."
