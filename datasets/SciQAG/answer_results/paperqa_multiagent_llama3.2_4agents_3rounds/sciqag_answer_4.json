    "question": "What were the key findings regarding glucose metabolism in the study?",
    "ground_truth": "The study found that in diabetes, glucose excretion was enormous, being nearly 7500-fold higher than in control rats. Other significantly enhanced metabolites included lactate, alanine, ethanol, and fumarate. These findings suggest that glucose metabolism is dramatically perturbed in diabetes.",
    "system_answer": "Key findings on glucose metabolism in diabetic rats include:\n\n* Altered excretion patterns\n* Increased glycolysis\n* Disrupted correlations between glycolytic intermediates and TCA cycle intermediates.\n\nThese changes indicate impaired glucose regulation, highlighting the complex metabolic shifts that occur in diabetes."
