    "question": "What is the significance of the template molecule's removal from the polymerized material in the molecular imprinting process?",
    "ground_truth": "The removal of template molecules from the polymerized material is essential for the formation of binding sites. After template molecules are removed, cavities complementary in size and shape to the template are formed. These cavities allow for the rebinding process and the creation of molecularly imprinted polymers.",
    "system_answer": "**Molecular Imprinting Process Significance**\n\nRemoval of template molecules creates distinct sites with enhanced selective recognition and binding properties. This leads to improved affinity and selectivity, enabling the material to selectively bind target molecules mimicking its original binding environment."
