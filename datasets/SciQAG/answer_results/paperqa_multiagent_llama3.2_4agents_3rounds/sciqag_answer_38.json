    "question": "How does the selectivity coefficient of the MIP based ISE towards discriminated ions compare to that of the NIP membrane electrode?",
    "ground_truth": "The proposed MIP membrane electrode shows high selectivity to melamine ion over other cations such as Na+, K+, H+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. The selectivity coefficients of the MIP based ISE are superior to those of the NIP membrane electrode due to the specific recognition of the MIP for the target ion.",
    "system_answer": "### Synthesized Answer:\n\nThe selectivity coefficient of MIP-based ISEs towards discriminated ions surpasses that of NIP membranes, primarily due to optimized composition and specific recognition of the target ion. This enables more efficient discrimination between targeted and non-targeted ions."
