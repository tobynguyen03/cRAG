    "question": "What is the role of metabolomics in healthcare?",
    "ground_truth": "Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations, providing a wealth of biological information on complex systems. It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and inborn errors of metabolism. It uses advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers and biological networks.",
    "system_answer": "Here's the synthesized answer:\n\nMetabolomics plays a vital role in healthcare by identifying biomarkers for disease states, classifying patients based on their metabolic profiles, and providing insights into biological endpoint effects. This helps facilitate personalized medicine, predict drug toxicity, and monitor treatment efficacy."
