    "question": "How does the degree of cross-linking affect the potential response of the MIP based membrane electrode?",
    "ground_truth": "The degree of cross-linking is the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer during the polymerization process. A higher degree of cross-linking may result in difficulties in removing the template from the polymer and insolubility of MIP in the solvent. Therefore, a suitable degree of cross-linking must be achieved to form stable binding sites.",
    "system_answer": "The degree of cross-linking significantly affects the potential response of MIP-based membrane electrodes. An optimal mole ratio of 3 strikes a balance between mechanical strength and conductivity, leading to improved performance for melamine analysis. This balance is crucial for achieving reliable and efficient separation processes."
