    "question": "What is the main technique used in the synthesis of Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs)?",
    "ground_truth": "The main technique used in the synthesis of MIPs is the molecular imprinting technique. This technique involves the use of functional monomers, template molecules, and a cross-linking agent. The polymerization process results in the formation of binding sites with molecular recognition properties.",
    "system_answer": "### Synthesized Answer:\n\nThe primary technique used in synthesizing Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) is non-covalent imprinting. This method involves the selective binding and encapsulation of target molecules within a polymer matrix, often facilitated by molecular recognition interactions such as hydrogen bonding or \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking."
