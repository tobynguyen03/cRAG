    "question": "How does the extraction temperature affect the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre?",
    "ground_truth": "To accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase their concentration in the headspace, a high extraction temperature is desirable. However, a high extraction temperature also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for lighter esters such as DMP and DEP.",
    "system_answer": "The optimal extraction temperature for SPME (Solid Phase Micro-extraction) fibre efficiency is typically between 40\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C. A peak extraction efficiency is often observed around 70\u00b0C, particularly for the release of phthalate esters. Higher temperatures can accelerate this process, but may also increase degradation of some analytes."
