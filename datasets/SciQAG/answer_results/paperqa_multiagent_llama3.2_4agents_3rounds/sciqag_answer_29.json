    "question": "What is the significance of the detection limit (DL) in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "The detection limit (DL) is a measure of the sensitivity of the analysis method. It is estimated using two different approaches, and in this study, the DL of analytes that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio of 3.",
    "system_answer": "The detection limit (DL) in analyzing phthalate esters is crucial for accurately detecting and quantifying low concentrations, as it sets a threshold value to distinguish between significant exposure and negligible levels. It affects sensitivity and specificity of analytical methods, enabling reliable measurement of these compounds in environmental samples. A DL below 1-2 \u03bcg/L is often considered optimal for sensitive detection."
