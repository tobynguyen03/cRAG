    "question": "What are the potential health impacts of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Phthalate esters, which are widely used as additives in the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, have endocrine disrupting properties. Studies have shown that they can be estrogenic and have reproductive effects in mammals. The European Commission is proposing a ban on the use of phthalate esters in soft PVC materials for making baby toys due to these potential health impacts.",
    "system_answer": "Phthalate esters pose significant health risks, particularly in terms of reproductive, developmental, and hormonal effects. Exposure to these chemicals has been linked to:\n\n- Reproductive issues\n- Developmental problems\n- Hormonal imbalances\n- Endocrine disruption\n\nThe estimated daily exposure exceeds the recommended tolerable intake, highlighting the need for safer alternatives and stricter regulations."
