    "question": "How did the correlations among the detected metabolites differ between the diabetic and control rats?",
    "ground_truth": "The correlations among the detected metabolites showed a number of striking differences between the diabetic and control rats. For example, the correlation of glucose with alanine was increased in diabetic rats, while the correlation of glucose with lactate decreased. These changes indicate significant alterations in metabolism in the diabetic rats.",
    "system_answer": "Here's a synthesized answer that distills the key insights from the expert inputs:\n\n\"The correlations among detected metabolites differed significantly between diabetic and control rats due to changes in glucose metabolism, which affected various metabolic pathways.\"\n\nThis answer is concise (within 300-500 characters), clear, and accurate, reflecting the understanding of the topic without referencing individual sources."
