    "question": "What is the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3?",
    "ground_truth": "The possible mechanism for the CL emission during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 is attributed to the oxidation processes of two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation.",
    "system_answer": "### Synthesized Answer:\n\nThe likely mechanism for CL (chemiluminescence) emission during ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 involves the formation of electronically excited acetaldehyde and ethylene intermediates. These intermediates decay into light-emitting species, resulting in CL emission.\n\nNote: This answer reflects the consensus among the expert inputs, highlighting the common key insights without referencing individual sources."
