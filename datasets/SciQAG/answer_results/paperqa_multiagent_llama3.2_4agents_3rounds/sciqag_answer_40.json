    "question": "How can the potential response of the MIP based membrane ISE be characterized?",
    "ground_truth": "The potential response of the MIP based membrane ISE can be characterized as rapid, fully reversible, and exhibiting a near-Nernstian response in the concentration range of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121. It also has a low detection limit and wide linearity range.",
    "system_answer": "### Synthesized Answer:\n\nThe potential response of the MIP-based membrane ISE can be characterized by measuring the change in voltage with respect to melamine concentration, while considering matrix effects. This characterization is crucial for accurate analysis and interpretation of results."
