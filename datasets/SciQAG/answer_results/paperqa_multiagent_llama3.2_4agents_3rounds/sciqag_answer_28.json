    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Here's a synthesized answer that captures the essence of internal standards in the analysis of phthalate esters:\n\n\"Internal standards correct for matrix effects, extraction efficiency, and instrumental response variations in phthalate ester analysis. They enable precise quantitation by suppressing isomeric interference, allowing for accurate measurement.\""
