    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards correct for variations in extraction efficiency, instrument calibration, and matrix effects to provide accurate analysis and quantification of phthalate esters. This ensures reliable results despite sample preparation and instrumental differences."
