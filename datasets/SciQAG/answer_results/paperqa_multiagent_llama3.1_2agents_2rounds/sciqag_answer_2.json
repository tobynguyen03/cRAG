    "question": "What is the role of metabolomics in healthcare?",
    "ground_truth": "Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations, providing a wealth of biological information on complex systems. It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and inborn errors of metabolism. It uses advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers and biological networks.",
    "system_answer": "Metabolomics plays a key role in healthcare by analyzing endogenous metabolites to identify biomarkers for diseases and develop personalized treatment strategies. It combines advanced analytical techniques with multivariate statistical analysis to predict disease mechanisms and tailor interventions accordingly."
