    "question": "What are the potential health impacts of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Phthalate esters, which are widely used as additives in the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, have endocrine disrupting properties. Studies have shown that they can be estrogenic and have reproductive effects in mammals. The European Commission is proposing a ban on the use of phthalate esters in soft PVC materials for making baby toys due to these potential health impacts.",
    "system_answer": "Phthalate esters may have negative health effects, including reproductive problems, hormonal imbalance (endocrine disruption), and increased cancer risk. They can enter the body through skin absorption, causing internal exposure."
