    "question": "What is the significance of the template molecule's removal from the polymerized material in the molecular imprinting process?",
    "ground_truth": "The removal of template molecules from the polymerized material is essential for the formation of binding sites. After template molecules are removed, cavities complementary in size and shape to the template are formed. These cavities allow for the rebinding process and the creation of molecularly imprinted polymers.",
    "system_answer": "The removal of the template molecule from polymerized material in molecular imprinting creates specific binding sites with molecular recognition properties, enabling selective and sensitive sensing. This process facilitates targeted interactions between the imprinted material and analyte molecules."
