    "question": "What is the significance of the detection limit (DL) in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "The detection limit (DL) is a measure of the sensitivity of the analysis method. It is estimated using two different approaches, and in this study, the DL of analytes that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio of 3.",
    "system_answer": "The detection limit (DL) is a critical parameter in phthalate ester analysis, representing the smallest amount that can be detected with reasonable certainty by an analytical method. It determines the minimum concentration that can be accurately measured, affecting the method's ability to detect low concentrations of these substances."
