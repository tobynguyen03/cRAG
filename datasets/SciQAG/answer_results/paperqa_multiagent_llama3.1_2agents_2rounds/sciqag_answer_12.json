    "question": "What is the significance of nanosized materials in the development of chemical sensors?",
    "ground_truth": "Nanosized materials have special features that differ from bulk materials, making them ideal for chemical sensing. They exhibit high activity, good selectivity and are small in size, which makes them perfect for chemical sensors.",
    "system_answer": "Nanosized materials hold great significance in the development of chemical sensors due to their high activity, selectivity, and small size. These features enable rapid reaction kinetics and high sensitivity for detecting gas molecules with precision."
