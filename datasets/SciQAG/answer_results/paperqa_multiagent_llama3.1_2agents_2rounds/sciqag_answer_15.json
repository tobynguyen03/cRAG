    "question": "How selective is the SrCO3 sensor for detecting ethanol among other gases?",
    "ground_truth": "The SrCO3 sensor exhibits a significantly high selectivity to ethanol. The sensor was not responsive to the passage of other gases such as gasoline, ammonia, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen under the optimized conditions.",
    "system_answer": "The SrCO3 sensor exhibits high selectivity for detecting ethanol among other gases. It demonstrates minimal response or interference from gasoline, ammonia, and hydrogen when operating within optimal parameters."
