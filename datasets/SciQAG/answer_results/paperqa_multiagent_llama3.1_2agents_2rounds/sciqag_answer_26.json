    "question": "How does the extraction temperature affect the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre?",
    "ground_truth": "To accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase their concentration in the headspace, a high extraction temperature is desirable. However, a high extraction temperature also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for lighter esters such as DMP and DEP.",
    "system_answer": "The extraction temperature has a complex and non-linear effect on SPME fibre efficiency. Higher and lower temperatures can impact efficiency differently, but there is no conclusive evidence that higher temperatures improve extraction efficiency. The relationship between temperature and efficiency requires further investigation."
