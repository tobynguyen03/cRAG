    "question": "What were the key findings regarding glucose metabolism in the study?",
    "ground_truth": "The study found that in diabetes, glucose excretion was enormous, being nearly 7500-fold higher than in control rats. Other significantly enhanced metabolites included lactate, alanine, ethanol, and fumarate. These findings suggest that glucose metabolism is dramatically perturbed in diabetes.",
    "system_answer": "The key findings regarding glucose metabolism in the study were:\n\n* Elevated plasma glucose levels\n* Increased glucose levels in urine\n* Impaired glucose metabolism\n* Disrupted correlations between glucose and other metabolites due to streptozotocin-induced disruptions."
