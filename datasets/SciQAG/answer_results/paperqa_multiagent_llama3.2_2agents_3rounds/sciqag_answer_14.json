    "question": "What is the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3?",
    "ground_truth": "The possible mechanism for the CL emission during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 is attributed to the oxidation processes of two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation.",
    "system_answer": "**Mechanism of CL Emission**\n\nThe oxidation of ethanol on SrCO\u2083 likely results in the formation of acetaldehyde, which undergoes vibrational excitation. This excited state leads to the emission of a Chlorine Luminescence (CL) signal. The role of ethylene oxidation is less clear and requires further investigation.\n\n**Key Insight:** Excited acetaldehyde is key to CL emission"
