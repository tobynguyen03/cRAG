    "question": "Why are MIPs considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts?",
    "ground_truth": "MIPs are considered stable because they are synthesized in the presence of functional monomers, template molecules, and a cross-linking agent. They are less costly because they require fewer steps and fewer reagents compared to the production of biological sensors such as antibodies and enzymes.",
    "system_answer": "### Synthesized Answer:\n\nMolecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) are considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts because they can be synthesized through controlled processes, eliminating the need for purification steps that are often challenging in biological systems. This scalability allows for mass production while minimizing costs."
