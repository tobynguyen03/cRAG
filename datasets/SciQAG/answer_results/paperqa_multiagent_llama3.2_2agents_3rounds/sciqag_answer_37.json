    "question": "What is the role of the ion-exchanger resin columns in the detection of melamine?",
    "ground_truth": "Ion-exchanger resin columns are used to eliminate the interference of anion and cation co-existing in milk samples. They are particularly effective at removing high concentrations of ions such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+ that are present in milk.",
    "system_answer": "Here is a synthesized answer:\n\nIon-exchanger resin columns play a crucial role in detecting melamine by removing interfering ions, enabling accurate analysis. This step is essential for flow analysis systems using molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) or ion-selective electrodes (ISE). By minimizing interference, the columns improve the detection's precision and reliability."
