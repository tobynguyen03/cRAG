    "question": "What is Type 1 diabetes and what causes it?",
    "ground_truth": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that results from the selective destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Genetics, environmental factors, nutritional effects, and a combination of these are believed to be associated with the disease. Streptozotocin (STZ) is commonly used to induce diabetes mellitus in experimental studies.",
    "system_answer": "**Type 1 Diabetes:**\n\nA chronic autoimmune condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This destruction leads to high blood sugar levels, as the body cannot produce enough insulin.\n\n**Causes:**\n\nA combination of genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development. The exact triggers are still unknown, but factors such as a weakened immune system, certain genes, and possibly viral infections may play a role."
