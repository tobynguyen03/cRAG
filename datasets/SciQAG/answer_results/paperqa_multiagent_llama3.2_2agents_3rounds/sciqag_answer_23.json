    "question": "What is the drawback of using solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis?",
    "ground_truth": "The use of solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis can present a drawback as residues of the solvent, especially DEHP, can also be found in the solvent. Moreover, fat in dairy product samples such as milk could be co-extracted and require extra steps to remove them prior to phthalate analysis, which makes the direct SPME method inappropriate for complex matrices such as milk and other dairy products.",
    "system_answer": "Using solvents in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis can lead to:\n\n* Low extraction efficiency\n* High matrix effects\n* Potential co-extraction of unwanted compounds\n* Toxicity concerns from solvent use.\n\nSolvent-based methods can complicate the analysis and produce inaccurate results."
