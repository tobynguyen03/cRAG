    "question": "How does the degree of cross-linking affect the potential response of the MIP based membrane electrode?",
    "ground_truth": "The degree of cross-linking is the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer during the polymerization process. A higher degree of cross-linking may result in difficulties in removing the template from the polymer and insolubility of MIP in the solvent. Therefore, a suitable degree of cross-linking must be achieved to form stable binding sites.",
    "system_answer": "The degree of cross-linking in MIP-based membrane electrodes can impact their performance. Moderate levels of cross-linking are often found to be optimal, as it strikes a balance between mechanical stability and permeability. Over-crosslinking can lead to reduced selectivity and flow rates, while under-crosslinking may result in decreased stability."
