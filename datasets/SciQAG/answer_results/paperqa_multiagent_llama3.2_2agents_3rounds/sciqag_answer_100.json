    "question": "How were the derivatives of aniline detected in this study?",
    "ground_truth": "The derivatives of aniline were detected using Gas Chromatography-ElectronCapture Detection (GC-ECD). After simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, a small sample of the sedimented phase was injected to GC\u2013MS for analysis.",
    "system_answer": "The derivatives of aniline were detected using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). This method provides a highly accurate and sensitive technique for identifying and quantifying the presence of aniline derivatives in a sample."
