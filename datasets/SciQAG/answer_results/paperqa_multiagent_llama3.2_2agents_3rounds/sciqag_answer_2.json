    "question": "What is the role of metabolomics in healthcare?",
    "ground_truth": "Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations, providing a wealth of biological information on complex systems. It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and inborn errors of metabolism. It uses advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers and biological networks.",
    "system_answer": "Here's the synthesized answer:\n\nMetabolomics is a critical tool in healthcare. It helps identify biomarkers for diseases, predicts organ-specific effects, and uncovers complex interactions between toxins and biological systems. By analyzing metabolic profiles, metabolomics provides insights into disease mechanisms, enabling early diagnosis, treatment, and personalized medicine."
