    "question": "How does the sample pH affect the potential response of the MIP based melamine ISE?",
    "ground_truth": "The potential response of the MIP based melamine ISE is not constant at all pH levels. It tends to decrease at pHs beyond 4.5, probably because at higher pH values, melamine exists as a neutral molecule showing no potential response.",
    "system_answer": "The pH of a sample affects the potential response of an MIP-based melamine ISE by altering selectivity and ion behavior. The optimal pH range for this sensor is typically between 3.0 and 4.5, where changes in ion behavior occur that enhance sensor accuracy."
