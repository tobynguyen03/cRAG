    "question": "How does the extraction temperature affect the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre?",
    "ground_truth": "To accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase their concentration in the headspace, a high extraction temperature is desirable. However, a high extraction temperature also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for lighter esters such as DMP and DEP.",
    "system_answer": "**Optimal Extraction Temperature for SPME Fibre**\n\nThe extraction temperature affects the efficiency of the SPME fibre by influencing desorption rates. An optimal range of 70-90\u00b0C is recommended, balancing desorption for both heavier and lighter phthalate esters to maximize extraction efficiency."
