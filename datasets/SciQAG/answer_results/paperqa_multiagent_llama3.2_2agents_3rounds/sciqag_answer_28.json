    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards in phthalate ester analysis:\n\n* Normalize interfering substances\n* Correct for extraction efficiency\n* Mitigate matrix effects (particularly those caused by fat content)\n* Enhance accuracy and reliability of results."
