    "question": "How were the absolute extraction efficiencies (AEEs) of the phthalate esters in milk samples determined?",
    "ground_truth": "The absolute extraction efficiencies (AEEs) were determined by comparing the amount of each phthalate ester collected on the fibre to the amount spiked in the milk sample. The AEE was dependent on the fat content in the milk samples, which made each milk sample a unique matrix.",
    "system_answer": "The absolute extraction efficiencies (AEEs) of phthalate esters in milk samples were determined through the analysis of recovery rates from spiked standards, comparing them to expected amounts. This approach involves applying Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) techniques, often combined with standard addition and calibration curve methods."
