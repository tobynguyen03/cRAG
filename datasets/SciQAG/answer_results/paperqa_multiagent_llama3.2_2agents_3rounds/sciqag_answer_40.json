    "question": "How can the potential response of the MIP based membrane ISE be characterized?",
    "ground_truth": "The potential response of the MIP based membrane ISE can be characterized as rapid, fully reversible, and exhibiting a near-Nernstian response in the concentration range of 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121. It also has a low detection limit and wide linearity range.",
    "system_answer": "The potential response of a MIP-based membrane ISE can be characterized by measuring changes in capacitance (CL) intensity as parameters such as temperature, flow rate, and ethanol concentration are varied. Another method is to measure potential change with varying concentrations of analytes like melamine. This helps assess the membrane's selectivity and sensitivity."
