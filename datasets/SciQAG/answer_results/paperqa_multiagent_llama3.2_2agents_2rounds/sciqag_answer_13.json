    "question": "How does the SrCO3 material used in the study respond to ethanol vapor?",
    "ground_truth": "The SrCO3 sensor responds to ethanol vapor with chemiluminescence (CL). The CL intensity increases sharply by about three orders of magnitude after ethanol vapor is introduced.",
    "system_answer": "SrCO3 (Strontium carbonate) does not react chemically with ethanol vapor under standard conditions. It remains inert in the presence of ethanol vapor, as the chemical reactivity is limited to specific environmental factors that are not present in this scenario."
