    "question": "What is the role of the ion-exchanger resin columns in the detection of melamine?",
    "ground_truth": "Ion-exchanger resin columns are used to eliminate the interference of anion and cation co-existing in milk samples. They are particularly effective at removing high concentrations of ions such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+ that are present in milk.",
    "system_answer": "Ion-exchanger resin columns play a crucial role in detecting melamine by leveraging their selective binding properties. This method involves passing a sample through the resin column, allowing melamine to bind while other ions pass through. The bound melamine is then eluted and analyzed, providing a reliable detection method."
