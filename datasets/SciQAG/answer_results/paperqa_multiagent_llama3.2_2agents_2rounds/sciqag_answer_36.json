    "question": "How does the sample pH affect the potential response of the MIP based melamine ISE?",
    "ground_truth": "The potential response of the MIP based melamine ISE is not constant at all pH levels. It tends to decrease at pHs beyond 4.5, probably because at higher pH values, melamine exists as a neutral molecule showing no potential response.",
    "system_answer": "The potential response of MIP-based melamine ISEs to sample pH is as follows: at high pH values (above 9), melamine's protonation state decreases, reducing binding efficiency. At low pH values (below 4), melamine decomposes, leading to inaccurate results."
