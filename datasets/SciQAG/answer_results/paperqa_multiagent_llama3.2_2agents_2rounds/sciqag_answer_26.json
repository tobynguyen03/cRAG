    "question": "How does the extraction temperature affect the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre?",
    "ground_truth": "To accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase their concentration in the headspace, a high extraction temperature is desirable. However, a high extraction temperature also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for lighter esters such as DMP and DEP.",
    "system_answer": "The extraction temperature significantly impacts the efficiency of SPME fibers. Optimal ranges vary depending on fiber type, but generally, temperatures that strike a balance between efficiency and retention are ideal. Higher temperatures can enhance extraction, while excessively high or low temperatures may compromise retention and overall performance."
