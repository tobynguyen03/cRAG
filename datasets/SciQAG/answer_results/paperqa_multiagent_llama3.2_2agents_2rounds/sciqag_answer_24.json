    "question": "What is the advantage of the headspace approach in SPME?",
    "ground_truth": "The headspace approach in SPME is advantageous because it eliminates the co-extraction of undissolved particles and non-volatile components in the sample matrix. This approach could be particularly useful in selectingively extracting phthalate esters because the fibre is not directly submerged in the matrix.",
    "system_answer": "The headspace approach in Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) reduces solvent usage while improving extraction efficiency, leading to enhanced environmental sustainability and better analytical performance. This method optimizes sampling conditions for effective separation of analytes from the matrix."
