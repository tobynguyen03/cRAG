    "question": "What is the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3?",
    "ground_truth": "The possible mechanism for the CL emission during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 is attributed to the oxidation processes of two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation.",
    "system_answer": "The likely mechanism for CL (cathodoluminescence) emission during ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 involves the interaction of oxygen vacancies with adsorbed water, resulting in hydroxyl radical formation, which reacts with ethanol to produce CL."
