    "question": "What is the significance of the detection limit (DL) in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "The detection limit (DL) is a measure of the sensitivity of the analysis method. It is estimated using two different approaches, and in this study, the DL of analytes that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio of 3.",
    "system_answer": "The detection limit (DL) is crucial in phthalate ester analysis as it determines the sensitivity and reliability of the method. A lower DL enables the detection and quantification of these compounds at lower concentrations, increasing the accuracy and precision of results.\n\nThis concise answer reflects a synthesis of Agent 0's explanation, focusing on the key point that a lower detection limit enhances analytical sensitivity and reliability."
