    "question": "How does the selectivity coefficient of the MIP based ISE towards discriminated ions compare to that of the NIP membrane electrode?",
    "ground_truth": "The proposed MIP membrane electrode shows high selectivity to melamine ion over other cations such as Na+, K+, H+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. The selectivity coefficients of the MIP based ISE are superior to those of the NIP membrane electrode due to the specific recognition of the MIP for the target ion.",
    "system_answer": "The MIP-based ISE exhibits significantly higher selectivity coefficients towards discriminated ions (e.g., Na+ and K+) compared to the NIP membrane electrode, allowing for more precise discrimination. This is due to the tailored molecular recognition sites in the MIP matrix, which enhance ion specificity."
