    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards enhance the accuracy of GC-MS analysis of phthalate esters. They compensate for matrix effects, improve quantification, and reduce co-extraction, allowing for more reliable results."
