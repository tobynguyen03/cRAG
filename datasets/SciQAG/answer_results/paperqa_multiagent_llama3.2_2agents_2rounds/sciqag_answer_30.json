    "question": "How was the method detection limit (MDL) calculated in this study?",
    "ground_truth": "The method detection limit (MDL) was calculated by dividing the detection limit by the absolute extraction efficiency. The MDLs of this method were in general lower than those previously reported, which makes this method more sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "The method detection limit (MDL) was calculated using a three-times standard deviation approach, considering the absolute extraction efficiency. This involves multiplying the standard deviation by 3 to determine the MDL threshold beyond which no signal can be detected due to extraction limitations."
