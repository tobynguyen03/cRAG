    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards play a crucial role in analyzing phthalate esters by:\n\n- Normalizing peak area counts\n- Improving detection limits\n- Correcting variations in extraction efficiency\n\nThis allows for accurate quantitation and reliable results in complex matrices, such as milk samples."
