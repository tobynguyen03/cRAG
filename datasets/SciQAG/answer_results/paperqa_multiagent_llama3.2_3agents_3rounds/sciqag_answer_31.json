    "question": "What is the main technique used in the synthesis of Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs)?",
    "ground_truth": "The main technique used in the synthesis of MIPs is the molecular imprinting technique. This technique involves the use of functional monomers, template molecules, and a cross-linking agent. The polymerization process results in the formation of binding sites with molecular recognition properties.",
    "system_answer": "The main technique used in synthesizing Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) is non-covalent imprinting. This method involves the controlled adsorption of template molecules onto a polymer support, followed by the removal of the template and the formation of a monomer-rich layer. The resulting polymer structure mimics the shape and properties of the original molecule, making it suitable for applications such as sensing and separation."
