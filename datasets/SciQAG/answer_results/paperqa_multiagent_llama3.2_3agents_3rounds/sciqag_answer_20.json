    "question": "How is the possible CL emission process from the oxidation of C2H4 and CH3CHO on SrCO3 explained?",
    "ground_truth": "The CL phenomenon from the catalytic oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 can be attributed to the oxidation processes of the two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation, C2H4 and CH3CHO. The CL emission processes of these gases are likely different, with CH3CHO producing only acetaldehyde as an intermediate.",
    "system_answer": "Here's a synthesized answer that reflects the best understanding of the topic without referencing individual inputs or sources:\n\n\"The possible CL (chloride lamp) emission process from the oxidation of C2H4 and CH3CHO on SrCO3 involves the interaction between CO2 and O2, resulting in the release of Cl ions. This occurs due to the catalytic properties of SrCO3, which facilitates the oxidation reactions.\""
