    "question": "How were the derivatives of aniline detected in this study?",
    "ground_truth": "The derivatives of aniline were detected using Gas Chromatography-ElectronCapture Detection (GC-ECD). After simultaneous DLLME and derivatization, a small sample of the sedimented phase was injected to GC\u2013MS for analysis.",
    "system_answer": "Here's a synthesized answer that reflects the best understanding of the topic:\n\n\"The derivatives of aniline were detected using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Optimization conditions and PFBAY derivatization reagent may have been applied to enhance detection accuracy.\""
