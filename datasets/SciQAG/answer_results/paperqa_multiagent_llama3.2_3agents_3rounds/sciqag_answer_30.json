    "question": "How was the method detection limit (MDL) calculated in this study?",
    "ground_truth": "The method detection limit (MDL) was calculated by dividing the detection limit by the absolute extraction efficiency. The MDLs of this method were in general lower than those previously reported, which makes this method more sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "The method detection limit (MDL) was not explicitly calculated in this study due to insufficient direct data. Alternative approaches were considered based on contextual information and summaries from other sources, as no explicit calculations could be made."
