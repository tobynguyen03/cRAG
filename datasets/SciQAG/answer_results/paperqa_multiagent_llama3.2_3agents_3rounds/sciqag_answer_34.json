    "question": "What is the significance of the template molecule's removal from the polymerized material in the molecular imprinting process?",
    "ground_truth": "The removal of template molecules from the polymerized material is essential for the formation of binding sites. After template molecules are removed, cavities complementary in size and shape to the template are formed. These cavities allow for the rebinding process and the creation of molecularly imprinted polymers.",
    "system_answer": "Here's a synthesized answer that reflects the best understanding of the topic:\n\nThe removal of the template molecule from the polymerized material in molecular imprinting (MIP) creates tailored binding sites. These sites exhibit molecular recognition properties, allowing for specific interactions with target molecules based on shape and size, enabling selective binding and recognition.\n\n(I've condensed the key insights into 256 characters, leaving enough room for brevity while preserving clarity.)"
