    "question": "What is the role of metabolomics in healthcare?",
    "ground_truth": "Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations, providing a wealth of biological information on complex systems. It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and inborn errors of metabolism. It uses advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers and biological networks.",
    "system_answer": "Metabolomics plays a crucial role in healthcare by analyzing the molecular footprints of biological systems to:\n\n- Predict toxicities and identify potential side effects\n- Uncover disease mechanisms and underlying causes\n- Discover new therapeutic targets for treatment and prevention\n\nThis holistic approach enables personalized medicine, improving diagnosis, and treatment outcomes."
