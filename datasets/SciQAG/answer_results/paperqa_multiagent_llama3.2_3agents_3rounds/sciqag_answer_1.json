    "question": "What is Type 1 diabetes and what causes it?",
    "ground_truth": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that results from the selective destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Genetics, environmental factors, nutritional effects, and a combination of these are believed to be associated with the disease. Streptozotocin (STZ) is commonly used to induce diabetes mellitus in experimental studies.",
    "system_answer": "Here's a synthesized answer:\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to a lack of insulin production. The exact cause is still unknown, but it's believed to result from a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental triggers."
