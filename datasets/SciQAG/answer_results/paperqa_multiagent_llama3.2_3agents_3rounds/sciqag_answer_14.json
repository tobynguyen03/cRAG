    "question": "What is the likely mechanism for the CL emission observed during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3?",
    "ground_truth": "The possible mechanism for the CL emission during the oxidation of ethanol on SrCO3 is attributed to the oxidation processes of two intermediates originated from the ethanol oxidation.",
    "system_answer": "The likely mechanism for CL (Cold Light) emission observed during ethanol oxidation on SrCO3 involves a catalytic reaction between ethanol and strontium carbonate. This results in the production of luminescent intermediates through an oxidation process, releasing energy as light."
