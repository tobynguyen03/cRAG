    "question": "Why are MIPs considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts?",
    "ground_truth": "MIPs are considered stable because they are synthesized in the presence of functional monomers, template molecules, and a cross-linking agent. They are less costly because they require fewer steps and fewer reagents compared to the production of biological sensors such as antibodies and enzymes.",
    "system_answer": "Here's a synthesized answer:\n\nMIPs are considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts due to controlled synthetic synthesis processes, simplified matrix deposition methods, and the elimination of degradation issues. These factors lead to reduced production costs and improved manufacturing efficiency."
