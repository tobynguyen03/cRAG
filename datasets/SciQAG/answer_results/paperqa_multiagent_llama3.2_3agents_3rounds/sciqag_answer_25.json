    "question": "Why was sodium chloride added to the milk sample during the extraction process?",
    "ground_truth": "Sodium chloride was added to saturate the milk sample to improve the extraction efficiency of the phthalate esters. The addition of salt can result in enhanced ion strength in the sample matrix and in increased vapour pressure in the headspace, which can aid in the extraction process.",
    "system_answer": "Adding sodium chloride to the milk sample creates an aprotic environment, which helps suppress background noise and enhance extraction efficiency for SPME fiber. This aids in accurate GC-MS analysis."
