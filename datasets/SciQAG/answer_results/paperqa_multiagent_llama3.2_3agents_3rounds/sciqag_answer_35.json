    "question": "How does the degree of cross-linking affect the potential response of the MIP based membrane electrode?",
    "ground_truth": "The degree of cross-linking is the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer during the polymerization process. A higher degree of cross-linking may result in difficulties in removing the template from the polymer and insolubility of MIP in the solvent. Therefore, a suitable degree of cross-linking must be achieved to form stable binding sites.",
    "system_answer": "The optimal degree of cross-linking for MIP-based membrane electrodes is around 3, resulting in improved sensor performance with features such as a wider linear range and lower detection limits. This moderate level of cross-linking strikes a balance between mechanical strength and molecular mobility, allowing for optimal interaction with target molecules."
