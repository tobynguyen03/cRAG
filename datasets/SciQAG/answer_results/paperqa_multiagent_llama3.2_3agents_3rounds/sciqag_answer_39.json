    "question": "How promising is the flow analysis system based on the MIP based membrane electrode for the detection of melamine in milk?",
    "ground_truth": "The flow analysis system based on the MIP based membrane electrode is very promising for the detection of melamine in milk. The system, which includes sample pretreatment, takes less than 15 minutes and has a detection limit of 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121.",
    "system_answer": "The MIP-based membrane electrode flow analysis system shows promise for detecting melamine in milk, with a detection limit of 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 mol L\u22121 and recoveries ranging from 95% to 110%. However, further validation is needed due to potential issues with excessive MIP amounts to ensure reliability and accuracy."
