    "question": "What is the significance of the detection limit (DL) in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "The detection limit (DL) is a measure of the sensitivity of the analysis method. It is estimated using two different approaches, and in this study, the DL of analytes that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio of 3.",
    "system_answer": "Detection limit (DL) is crucial in analyzing phthalate esters as it determines the minimum amount that can be detected with confidence. A lower DL enhances sensitivity and accuracy, allowing for the detection of smaller amounts of these substances. This improves extraction efficiency and overall analytical accuracy."
