    "question": "How selective is the SrCO3 sensor for detecting ethanol among other gases?",
    "ground_truth": "The SrCO3 sensor exhibits a significantly high selectivity to ethanol. The sensor was not responsive to the passage of other gases such as gasoline, ammonia, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen under the optimized conditions.",
    "system_answer": "The SrCO3 sensor demonstrates high selectivity for detecting ethanol, exhibiting stable and durable performance across varying concentrations. This suggests that it can effectively distinguish between ethanol and other gases, making it a reliable choice for detection applications."
