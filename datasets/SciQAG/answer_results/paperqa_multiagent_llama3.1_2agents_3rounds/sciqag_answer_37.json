    "question": "What is the role of the ion-exchanger resin columns in the detection of melamine?",
    "ground_truth": "Ion-exchanger resin columns are used to eliminate the interference of anion and cation co-existing in milk samples. They are particularly effective at removing high concentrations of ions such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+ that are present in milk.",
    "system_answer": "The ion-exchange resin columns play a crucial role in the detection of melamine by eliminating interference from high ion concentrations in milk, enabling accurate and sensitive measurement."
