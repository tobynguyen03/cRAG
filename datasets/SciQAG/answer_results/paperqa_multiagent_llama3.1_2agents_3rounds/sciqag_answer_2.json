    "question": "What is the role of metabolomics in healthcare?",
    "ground_truth": "Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations, providing a wealth of biological information on complex systems. It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and inborn errors of metabolism. It uses advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers and biological networks.",
    "system_answer": "Metabolomics is a powerful tool in healthcare that detects biological endpoint-effects, identifies biomarkers for diseases, predicts drug toxicity, and understands dose-related effects of toxins. It enables early identification of toxicological side-effects and minimizes compound 'attrition', ultimately improving patient outcomes and treatment efficacy."
