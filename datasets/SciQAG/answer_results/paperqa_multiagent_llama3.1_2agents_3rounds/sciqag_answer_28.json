    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards are essential for analyzing phthalate esters. They correct for extraction efficiency, ensuring accurate quantification by normalizing peak area counts, allowing for precise determination of these compounds."
