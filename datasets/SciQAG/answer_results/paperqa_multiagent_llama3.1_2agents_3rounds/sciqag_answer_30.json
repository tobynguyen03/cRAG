    "question": "How was the method detection limit (MDL) calculated in this study?",
    "ground_truth": "The method detection limit (MDL) was calculated by dividing the detection limit by the absolute extraction efficiency. The MDLs of this method were in general lower than those previously reported, which makes this method more sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "The method detection limit (MDL) was calculated by taking three times the standard deviation of five replicated runs of spiked samples at the lowest concentration on the calibration curve, resulting in a range of 0.04-0.09 \u03bcg/L."
