    "question": "What is the significance of the template molecule's removal from the polymerized material in the molecular imprinting process?",
    "ground_truth": "The removal of template molecules from the polymerized material is essential for the formation of binding sites. After template molecules are removed, cavities complementary in size and shape to the template are formed. These cavities allow for the rebinding process and the creation of molecularly imprinted polymers.",
    "system_answer": "The template molecule's removal from the polymerized material is significant as it enables specific recognition and selective binding through the creation of complementary binding sites. This allows for the recognition and binding of target molecules, mimicking the template's shape and chemical properties."
