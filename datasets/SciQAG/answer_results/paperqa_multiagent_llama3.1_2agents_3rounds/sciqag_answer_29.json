    "question": "What is the significance of the detection limit (DL) in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "The detection limit (DL) is a measure of the sensitivity of the analysis method. It is estimated using two different approaches, and in this study, the DL of analytes that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio of 3.",
    "system_answer": "The detection limit (DL) is an essential parameter in analytical chemistry, determining the minimum concentration of a substance (such as phthalate esters) that can be accurately measured. It indicates the lowest amount of a substance detectable with a specified level of certainty and reliability."
