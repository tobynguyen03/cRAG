    "question": "How does the selectivity coefficient of the MIP based ISE towards discriminated ions compare to that of the NIP membrane electrode?",
    "ground_truth": "The proposed MIP membrane electrode shows high selectivity to melamine ion over other cations such as Na+, K+, H+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. The selectivity coefficients of the MIP based ISE are superior to those of the NIP membrane electrode due to the specific recognition of the MIP for the target ion.",
    "system_answer": "The MIP (Molecularly Imprinted Polymer) based ISE has a higher selectivity coefficient for discriminated ions compared to the NIP (Non-Imprinted Polymer) membrane electrode, allowing it to more accurately detect and measure specific ions."
