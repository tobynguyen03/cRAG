    "question": "What is the drawback of using solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis?",
    "ground_truth": "The use of solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis can present a drawback as residues of the solvent, especially DEHP, can also be found in the solvent. Moreover, fat in dairy product samples such as milk could be co-extracted and require extra steps to remove them prior to phthalate analysis, which makes the direct SPME method inappropriate for complex matrices such as milk and other dairy products.",
    "system_answer": "The primary drawback of using a solvent in sample preparation for phthalate ester analysis is the co-extraction of residues, particularly DEHP, which can lead to increased method detection limits (MDLs) and potential issues with solubility or toxicity."
