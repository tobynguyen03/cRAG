    "question": "How does the sample pH affect the potential response of the MIP based melamine ISE?",
    "ground_truth": "The potential response of the MIP based melamine ISE is not constant at all pH levels. It tends to decrease at pHs beyond 4.5, probably because at higher pH values, melamine exists as a neutral molecule showing no potential response.",
    "system_answer": "The sample pH significantly impacts the response of the MIP-based melamine ion-selective electrode (ISE). Optimal sensitivity is achieved when the sample pH is around 4.6."
