    "question": "What is the advantage of the headspace approach in SPME?",
    "ground_truth": "The headspace approach in SPME is advantageous because it eliminates the co-extraction of undissolved particles and non-volatile components in the sample matrix. This approach could be particularly useful in selectingively extracting phthalate esters because the fibre is not directly submerged in the matrix.",
    "system_answer": "The headspace approach in SPME (Solid Phase Microextraction) is advantageous because it eliminates co-extraction of undissolved particles and non-volatile components, allowing for selective extraction and increased efficiency in detecting semi-volatile organic compounds."
