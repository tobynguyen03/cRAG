    "question": "What is the importance of temperature in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor?",
    "ground_truth": "Temperature plays a significant role in the CL emission process in the SrCO3 sensor. The CL signal increases with the increase in temperature, indicating that the catalytic oxidation process that produces the luminescent intermediates is under a diffusion controlled condition at flow rate below a certain temperature, and is under a reaction controlled condition at flow rate above that temperature.",
    "system_answer": "Temperature plays a critical role in controlling the chemiluminescence (CL) emission process of the SrCO3 sensor. It influences both the relative intensity of the emitted light and the optimal performance of the sensor, affecting its overall accuracy and reliability."
