    "question": "What were the key findings regarding glucose metabolism in the study?",
    "ground_truth": "The study found that in diabetes, glucose excretion was enormous, being nearly 7500-fold higher than in control rats. Other significantly enhanced metabolites included lactate, alanine, ethanol, and fumarate. These findings suggest that glucose metabolism is dramatically perturbed in diabetes.",
    "system_answer": "The study found that diabetic rats had impaired glucose homeostasis, with disruptions to the TCA cycle function and increased gluconeogenesis. This resulted in elevated plasma glucose levels and altered correlations among metabolites."
