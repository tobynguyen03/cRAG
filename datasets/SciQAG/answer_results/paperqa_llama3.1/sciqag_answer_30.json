    "question": "How was the method detection limit (MDL) calculated in this study?",
    "ground_truth": "The method detection limit (MDL) was calculated by dividing the detection limit by the absolute extraction efficiency. The MDLs of this method were in general lower than those previously reported, which makes this method more sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "The MDL was calculated using three different methods: multiplying the standard deviation by 3, dividing the DL by AEE, and defining it based on equilibrated potential signals."
