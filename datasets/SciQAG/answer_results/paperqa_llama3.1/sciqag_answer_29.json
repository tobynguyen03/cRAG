    "question": "What is the significance of the detection limit (DL) in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "The detection limit (DL) is a measure of the sensitivity of the analysis method. It is estimated using two different approaches, and in this study, the DL of analytes that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio of 3.",
    "system_answer": "The detection limit (DL) is significant in the analysis of phthalate esters as it provides the lowest concentration of an analyte that can be accurately measured, and its determination is crucial for evaluating the sensitivity and accuracy of analytical methods."
