    "question": "How selective is the SrCO3 sensor for detecting ethanol among other gases?",
    "ground_truth": "The SrCO3 sensor exhibits a significantly high selectivity to ethanol. The sensor was not responsive to the passage of other gases such as gasoline, ammonia, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen under the optimized conditions.",
    "system_answer": "The SrCO3 sensor is highly selective for detecting ethanol among other gases due to its unique properties as a nanosized material and its ability to produce chemiluminescence (CL) upon the oxidation of ethanol."
