    "question": "What is the significance of nanosized materials in the development of chemical sensors?",
    "ground_truth": "Nanosized materials have special features that differ from bulk materials, making them ideal for chemical sensing. They exhibit high activity, good selectivity and are small in size, which makes them perfect for chemical sensors.",
    "system_answer": "Nanosized materials are significant in chemical sensor development due to their high activity and selectivity, enabling the detection of small gas molecule concentrations with high sensitivity and specificity."
