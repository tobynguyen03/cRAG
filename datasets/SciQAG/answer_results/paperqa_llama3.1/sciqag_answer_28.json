    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards (DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4) are used to accurately quantify phthalate esters by normalizing peak area counts, identifying true positives, and correcting for extraction efficiency."
