    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards play a crucial role in the analysis of phthalate esters by compensating for matrix effects, ensuring accurate quantification of concentrations. They help normalize sample matrices, allowing for precise measurement and reducing interference from environmental factors."
