    "question": "How does the sample pH affect the potential response of the MIP based melamine ISE?",
    "ground_truth": "The potential response of the MIP based melamine ISE is not constant at all pH levels. It tends to decrease at pHs beyond 4.5, probably because at higher pH values, melamine exists as a neutral molecule showing no potential response.",
    "system_answer": "**Sample pH Impact on MIP-Based Melamine ISE**\n\nThe sample pH significantly affects the MIP-based melamine ISE's response due to changes in melamine ion protonation states at pH above 4.5. This results from the increased availability of free melamine ions, which interact with the MIP sensor, leading to a measurable signal change."
