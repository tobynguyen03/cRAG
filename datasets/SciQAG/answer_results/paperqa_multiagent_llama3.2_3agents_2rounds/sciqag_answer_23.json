    "question": "What is the drawback of using solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis?",
    "ground_truth": "The use of solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis can present a drawback as residues of the solvent, especially DEHP, can also be found in the solvent. Moreover, fat in dairy product samples such as milk could be co-extracted and require extra steps to remove them prior to phthalate analysis, which makes the direct SPME method inappropriate for complex matrices such as milk and other dairy products.",
    "system_answer": "The use of solvent in sample preparation for phthalate ester analysis can lead to:\n\n* Cross-contamination, compromising the integrity of samples\n* Loss of accuracy due to incomplete recovery of analytes\n* Higher detection limits, reducing the sensitivity of the analysis\n\nOverall, using solvents can compromise the reliability and efficiency of phthalate ester analysis."
