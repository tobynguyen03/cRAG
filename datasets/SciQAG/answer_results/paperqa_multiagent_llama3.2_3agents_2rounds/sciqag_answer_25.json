    "question": "Why was sodium chloride added to the milk sample during the extraction process?",
    "ground_truth": "Sodium chloride was added to saturate the milk sample to improve the extraction efficiency of the phthalate esters. The addition of salt can result in enhanced ion strength in the sample matrix and in increased vapour pressure in the headspace, which can aid in the extraction process.",
    "system_answer": "Sodium chloride was added to reduce the volatility of phthalate esters, making them more easily extracted onto the SPME fibre. This facilitated the selective extraction process, allowing for a more efficient separation of target compounds from other milk components."
