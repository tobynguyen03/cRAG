    "question": "How does the degree of cross-linking affect the potential response of the MIP based membrane electrode?",
    "ground_truth": "The degree of cross-linking is the mole ratio of cross-linker/monomer during the polymerization process. A higher degree of cross-linking may result in difficulties in removing the template from the polymer and insolubility of MIP in the solvent. Therefore, a suitable degree of cross-linking must be achieved to form stable binding sites.",
    "system_answer": "Here is a synthesized answer that reflects the best understanding of the topic:\n\n\"The degree of cross-linking improves MIP-based membrane electrode performance by increasing stability, leading to a wider linear range and lower detection limit. However, high levels of cross-linking can pose technical challenges such as difficult template removal and insolubility.\""
