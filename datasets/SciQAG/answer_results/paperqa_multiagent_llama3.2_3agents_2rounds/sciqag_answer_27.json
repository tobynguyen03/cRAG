    "question": "How were the absolute extraction efficiencies (AEEs) of the phthalate esters in milk samples determined?",
    "ground_truth": "The absolute extraction efficiencies (AEEs) were determined by comparing the amount of each phthalate ester collected on the fibre to the amount spiked in the milk sample. The AEE was dependent on the fat content in the milk samples, which made each milk sample a unique matrix.",
    "system_answer": "The absolute extraction efficiencies (AEEs) of phthalate esters in milk samples were determined through a combination of methods, including:\n\n* Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) with standard addition and detection limit estimation for accuracy\n* Headspace-Solid Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME) to enhance efficiency\n* Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis for precise quantification and identification of phthalate esters.\n\nThese methods were chosen to provide a comprehensive understanding of the AEEs in milk samples."
