    "question": "What is the significance of the template molecule's removal from the polymerized material in the molecular imprinting process?",
    "ground_truth": "The removal of template molecules from the polymerized material is essential for the formation of binding sites. After template molecules are removed, cavities complementary in size and shape to the template are formed. These cavities allow for the rebinding process and the creation of molecularly imprinted polymers.",
    "system_answer": "Removal of template molecules from polymerized material creates binding sites with tailored recognition properties. This enables selective rebinding of target analytes, allowing for accurate detection and quantification in MIP-based sensors. The resulting binding sites mimic the shape and chemical properties of the original template molecule, facilitating specific interactions with target analytes."
