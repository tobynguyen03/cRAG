    "question": "What is the significance of the detection limit (DL) in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "The detection limit (DL) is a measure of the sensitivity of the analysis method. It is estimated using two different approaches, and in this study, the DL of analytes that do not have detectable background levels in the SPME fibre was estimated by the injected amount that resulted in an instrument signal to noise ratio of 3.",
    "system_answer": "The detection limit (DL) in phthalate esters analysis is crucial for sensitivity, accuracy, and reliability. A low DL enables the detection of trace amounts of analytes, such as DEHP, allowing for more efficient and reliable analysis. This is particularly important in milk samples where even small concentrations can pose health risks."
