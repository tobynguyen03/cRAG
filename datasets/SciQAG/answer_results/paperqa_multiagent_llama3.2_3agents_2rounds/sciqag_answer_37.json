    "question": "What is the role of the ion-exchanger resin columns in the detection of melamine?",
    "ground_truth": "Ion-exchanger resin columns are used to eliminate the interference of anion and cation co-existing in milk samples. They are particularly effective at removing high concentrations of ions such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+ that are present in milk.",
    "system_answer": "Here is a synthesized answer:\n\nIon-exchanger resin columns play a crucial role in detecting melamine by removing interfering ions from milk samples, improving the accuracy of flow analysis systems. This enhances the linearity range and detection limits, allowing for more accurate melamine detection."
