    "question": "How does the extraction temperature affect the extraction efficiency of the SPME fibre?",
    "ground_truth": "To accelerate the release of phthalate esters from the milk matrix and increase their concentration in the headspace, a high extraction temperature is desirable. However, a high extraction temperature also reduces the retaining power of the coating materials, especially for lighter esters such as DMP and DEP.",
    "system_answer": "The extraction temperature significantly impacts the efficiency of SPME fibers, affecting both compound stability and fiber uptake. The optimal range for most compounds is typically between 40-70\u00b0C, although variations occur depending on the specific target molecule.\n\nTo achieve maximum extraction efficiency, consider factors such as:\n\n*   Compound volatility and thermal stability\n*   Fiber material properties (e.g., silicone content)"
