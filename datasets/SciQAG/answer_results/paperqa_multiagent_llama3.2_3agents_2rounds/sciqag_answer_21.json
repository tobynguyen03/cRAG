    "question": "What are the potential health impacts of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Phthalate esters, which are widely used as additives in the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, have endocrine disrupting properties. Studies have shown that they can be estrogenic and have reproductive effects in mammals. The European Commission is proposing a ban on the use of phthalate esters in soft PVC materials for making baby toys due to these potential health impacts.",
    "system_answer": "Here is a synthesized answer based on the expert inputs:\n\nPhthalate esters pose significant health risks due to their endocrine-disrupting properties. They have been linked to reproductive issues, developmental delays, and increased cancer risk, primarily through dermal exposure and contamination of food products. This highlights the importance of minimizing exposure to phthalates to protect human health."
