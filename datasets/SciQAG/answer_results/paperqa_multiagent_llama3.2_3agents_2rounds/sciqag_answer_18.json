    "question": "How is the CL intensity of the SrCO3 sensor related to the concentration of ethanol vapor?",
    "ground_truth": "The CL intensity of the SrCO3 sensor increases with the increase in the concentration of ethanol vapor. A calibration curve of CL intensity versus ethanol vapor concentration was created and was found to be linear in the tested range.",
    "system_answer": "The CL intensity of the SrCO3 sensor shows a positive correlation with ethanol vapor concentration within a linear range of 6-3750 ppm, with a detection limit of 2.1 ppm. This suggests that as ethanol vapor concentrations increase, the sensor's luminescence also increases in a predictable and quantifiable manner."
