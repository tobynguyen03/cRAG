    "question": "How selective is the SrCO3 sensor for detecting ethanol among other gases?",
    "ground_truth": "The SrCO3 sensor exhibits a significantly high selectivity to ethanol. The sensor was not responsive to the passage of other gases such as gasoline, ammonia, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen under the optimized conditions.",
    "system_answer": "The SrCO3 sensor exhibits high selectivity for detecting ethanol due to its unique reaction mechanism. It shows a strong preference for ethanol detection over other gases. This selectivity is supported by experimental validation and its response profile."
