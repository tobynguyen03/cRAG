    "question": "What is the role of metabolomics in healthcare?",
    "ground_truth": "Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations, providing a wealth of biological information on complex systems. It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and inborn errors of metabolism. It uses advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers and biological networks.",
    "system_answer": "### Synthesized Answer:\n\nMetabolomics is a vital tool in healthcare, enabling the detection of biological endpoint effects, identification of biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment, and development of personalized treatment strategies. It facilitates early detection of toxicological side-effects, disease states, and nutritional effects, providing rapid pre-clinical screening and diagnostic power to predict toxic effects. This approach enhances patient outcomes by tailoring treatments to individual needs."
