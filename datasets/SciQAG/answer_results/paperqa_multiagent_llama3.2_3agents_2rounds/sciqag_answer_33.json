    "question": "Why are MIPs considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts?",
    "ground_truth": "MIPs are considered stable because they are synthesized in the presence of functional monomers, template molecules, and a cross-linking agent. They are less costly because they require fewer steps and fewer reagents compared to the production of biological sensors such as antibodies and enzymes.",
    "system_answer": "Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) are considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts due to:\n\n* Controlled synthesis using commercial monomers and templates\n* Reduced purification processes due to non-biological nature\n* Precise control over molecular structure and composition.\n\nThis precise control leads to increased stability, consistency, and lower production costs."
