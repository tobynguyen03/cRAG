    "question": "What role do internal standards play in the analysis of phthalate esters?",
    "ground_truth": "Internal standards, such as DEHP-d4 and DBP-d4 used in this study, are essential as they help to correct for extraction efficiency. Without internal standards, the detection limit would be lower and the method would be less sensitive.",
    "system_answer": "Internal standards, such as DBP-d4 and DEHP-d4, correct for variations in instrument sensitivity and matrix effects to ensure accurate quantification of phthalate esters. They allow for precise measurement by compensating for potential errors in the analysis process."
