    "question": "Why are MIPs considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts?",
    "ground_truth": "MIPs are considered stable because they are synthesized in the presence of functional monomers, template molecules, and a cross-linking agent. They are less costly because they require fewer steps and fewer reagents compared to the production of biological sensors such as antibodies and enzymes.",
    "system_answer": "MIPs (Molecularly Imprinted Polymers) are considered stable, less costly, and easier to produce than their biological counterparts due to their synthetic nature, controlled structure, and reproducibility. This allows for precise control over production, reducing variability and costs associated with biological systems."
