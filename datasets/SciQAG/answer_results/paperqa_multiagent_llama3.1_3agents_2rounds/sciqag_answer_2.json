    "question": "What is the role of metabolomics in healthcare?",
    "ground_truth": "Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field that relates biological end points to multiple altered metabolite concentrations, providing a wealth of biological information on complex systems. It has been applied to a variety of diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and inborn errors of metabolism. It uses advanced analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers and biological networks.",
    "system_answer": "Metabolomics plays a crucial role in healthcare by analyzing metabolic pathways to detect and predict toxicological effects, screen for drug toxicity, and identify potential biomarkers associated with disease. This helps in early diagnosis, personalized medicine, and targeted treatment strategies."
