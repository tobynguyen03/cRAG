    "question": "What is the advantage of the headspace approach in SPME?",
    "ground_truth": "The headspace approach in SPME is advantageous because it eliminates the co-extraction of undissolved particles and non-volatile components in the sample matrix. This approach could be particularly useful in selectingively extracting phthalate esters because the fibre is not directly submerged in the matrix.",
    "system_answer": "The headspace approach in SPME offers advantages such as enhanced extraction efficiency, accelerated release of analytes, increased concentration, and minimized use of solvents for cleaning. This approach improves the accuracy and speed of analysis."
