    "question": "How does the SrCO3 material used in the study respond to ethanol vapor?",
    "ground_truth": "The SrCO3 sensor responds to ethanol vapor with chemiluminescence (CL). The CL intensity increases sharply by about three orders of magnitude after ethanol vapor is introduced.",
    "system_answer": "The SrCO3 material generates chemiluminescence when exposed to ethanol vapor, catalyzing its oxidation in a highly selective and sensitive manner."
