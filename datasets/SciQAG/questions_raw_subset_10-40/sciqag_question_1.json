    "What is Type 1 diabetes and what causes it?": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that results from the selective destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Genetics, environmental factors, nutritional effects, and a combination of these are believed to be associated with the disease. Streptozotocin (STZ) is commonly used to induce diabetes mellitus in experimental studies."
