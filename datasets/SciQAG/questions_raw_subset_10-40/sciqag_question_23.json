    "What is the drawback of using solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis?": "The use of solvent in sample preparation for phthalate esters analysis can present a drawback as residues of the solvent, especially DEHP, can also be found in the solvent. Moreover, fat in dairy product samples such as milk could be co-extracted and require extra steps to remove them prior to phthalate analysis, which makes the direct SPME method inappropriate for complex matrices such as milk and other dairy products."
