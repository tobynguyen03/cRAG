    "What role does metabonomic data analysis play in the identification of toxic effects?": "Metabonomic data analysis using 1H NMR spectroscopy, together with chemometric techniques, can provide valuable insights into the scope of large-scale toxicological projects. It can help predict and interpret large-scale data sets, enabling the development of new analytical tools and facilitating the prediction of different toxins' effects."
