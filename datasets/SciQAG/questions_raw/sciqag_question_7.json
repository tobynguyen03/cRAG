    "How did the urinary metabolites differ between diabetic and control rats in the study?": "The urinary metabolites showed dramatic changes in the rat diabetic model when compared with blood-based assays. Glucose was the most notable metabolite in diabetic urine, with very high-intensity signals. Other metabolites such as alanine, lactate, ethanol, acetate, and fumarate also showed significant increases in the diabetic group."
