    "How was the dry matrix deposition protocol tested in the study?": "The dry matrix deposition protocol was tested by acquiring positive ionization mode ion images at 30- to 100-\u03bcm lateral resolution using a MALDI TOF mass spectrometer. The results showed that the protocol allows reproducible high-resolution phospholipid images to be obtained."
