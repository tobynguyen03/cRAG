    "How is BPA exposure assessed in the study?": "The study used samples of thermal printing papers, which include the printing ink covering the whole surface on the side to be printed. The colorant consists of a leuco dye, which is a molecule that can adopt two forms, one of which is colorless. On printing, a thermal head causes the components to melt and react with each other, causing the dye to become dark."
