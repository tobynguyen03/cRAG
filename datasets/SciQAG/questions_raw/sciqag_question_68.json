    "How does the response of hierarchical nanostructures compare to that of SnO2 NWs in gas sensing?": "The hierarchical nanostructures exhibit enhanced gas sensing performance, which may be attributed to high porosity, more active sites, and addition of core\u2013outer junctions to the materials. Therefore, the synthesized hierarchical nanostructures have promising potential for gas sensor applications."
