    "How does the permanent DDM coating on PDMS work?": "The permanent coating of the PDMS surface with DDM is achieved by incubating the PDMS channel with DHBS for 5 minutes and then washing it either by pipet flushing or with a constant flow. The channel is then incubated with protein/HBS solution for 5 minutes and washed with HBS. This process reduces the nonspecifically bound streptavidin to the single molecule level."
