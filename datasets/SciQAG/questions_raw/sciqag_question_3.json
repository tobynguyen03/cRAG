    "How was the diabetic rat model established in this study?": "In this study, female rats were divided into a diabetic group and a control group. The diabetic group received an intraperitoneal dose of STZ, and showed glucose levels in the blood of more than 200 mg/dl after 4 days. The control group was matched for age and gender, and did not receive the STZ injection."
