    "How do temperature and gas concentration affect the response of the hierarchical SnO2 nanostructure sensors?": "The temperature has a significant influence on the response of the sensors to LPG and NH3 gas. The hierarchical SnO2 nanostructure exhibits enhanced responses for each concentration. Therefore, the optimal performance is achieved at 350 and 200 \u00b0C for LPG and NH3 gas, respectively."
