    "What is the role of Gas Chromatography-ElectronCapture Detection (GC-ECD) in the study of anilines?": "Gas Chromatography-ElectronCapture Detection (GC-ECD) is used for the analysis of anilines in environmental samples. It is often used in combination with High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Simultaneous Liquid-Phase Microextraction (LPME) for the determination of these compounds in water and other samples."
