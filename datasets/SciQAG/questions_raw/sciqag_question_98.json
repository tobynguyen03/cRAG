    "How does the temperature affect the sensitivity of the DLLME method?": "Raising the temperature during extraction and derivatization causes different derivatization performance and solubility of analytes in aqueous. The sensitivity decreased by increasing the extraction and derivatization temperature from 30 to 60 \u00b0C."
