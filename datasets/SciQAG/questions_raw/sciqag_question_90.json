    "How can DDM coating be beneficial in various systems?": "DDM coating can be applied to a wide variety of systems where a small percentage of DDM can be tolerated. It can be beneficial in reducing protein adsorption to a PDMS surface and also in reducing the electroosmotic flow in PDMS channels, which is useful in many applications. It may even become a general procedure for reducing nonspecific protein adsorption on other hydrophobic surfaces."
