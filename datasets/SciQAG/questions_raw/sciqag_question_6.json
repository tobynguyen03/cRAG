    "What is the role of acetate switch in metabolism?": "The acetate switch, also known as the molecular switch that regulates the dissimilation and assimilation of acetate, plays a role in accumulating an acetyl\u2013coenzyme A (CoA) pool due to both exogenous (bacterial fermentation) and endogenous (mammalian) production. This accumulation can have significant implications for metabolism."
