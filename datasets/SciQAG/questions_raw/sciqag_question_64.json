    "How is the two-step thermal evaporation process used in the synthesis of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures?": "The two-step thermal evaporation process is used to synthesize hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures. In the first step, core NWs are grown at a high temperature, and in the second step, outer secondary NWs are grown by reseeding of nanoparticle catalysts on the core NWs surface."
