    "What is the significance of the Au catalyst in the synthesis of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures?": "The use of the Au catalyst in the second growth step of SnO2 branches may have enhanced the gas sensing performance of the hierarchical nanostructures. This is likely the case with SnO2 NWs functionalized with nanoparticle catalysts."
