    "What is the role of gold nanoparticles in the enhancement of gas sensing properties of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures?": "It is suggested that the gas sensing properties of hierarchical SnO2 nanostructures are enhanced by the deposition of gold nanoparticles in the core NWs before the second step of the thermal evaporation process. This is likely because the materials are functionalized with catalyst active materials (Au catalyst)."
