    "What is the importance of the Cori cycle in maintaining glucose homeostasis?": "The Cori cycle, also known as the glucose-lactate cycle, is a metabolic pathway that plays a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. It involves the conversion of glucose, lactate, and alanine, and is responsible for producing Cori cycle intermediates, which are used in gluconeogenesis precursor production and facilitating glucose oxidation."
