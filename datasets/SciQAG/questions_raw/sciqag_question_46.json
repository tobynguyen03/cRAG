    "How does the dry-coating method produce high-quality molecular images?": "The dry-coating method produces high-quality molecular images by allowing dozens of ion images to be generated from each dry-coated imaging experiment. These images clearly differentiate the anatomical structures of the brain and show signal intensity and phospholipid localization similar to those obtained from the spray-coated tissue section."
