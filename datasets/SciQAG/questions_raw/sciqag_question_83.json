    "How does n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside (DDM) interact with hydrophobic surfaces?": "n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside (DDM) is an alkyl polyglucoside that strongly adsorbs on hydrophobic surfaces, forming a monolayer. This monolayer coverage causes the surface to become hydrophilic and nonionic, thus reducing the interaction between the protein and the surface."
