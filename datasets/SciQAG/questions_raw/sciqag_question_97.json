    "How does the pH of the sample solution affect the derivatization and extraction efficiency?": "The study found that the sensitivity of the derivatization and extraction process is affected by the pH of the sample solution. Lowering the pH value from 7.8 to 4.6, for example, enhanced the sensitivity, but sensitivity decreased below pH 4.6."
