    "How is the CL intensity of the SrCO3 sensor related to the concentration of ethanol vapor?": "The CL intensity of the SrCO3 sensor increases with the increase in the concentration of ethanol vapor. A calibration curve of CL intensity versus ethanol vapor concentration was created and was found to be linear in the tested range."
