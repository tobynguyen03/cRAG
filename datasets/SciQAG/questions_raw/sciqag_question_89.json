    "How does DDM coating affect the electroosmotic flow (EOF) in PDMS channels?": "The DDM coating reduces the EOF by covering the charges on the PDMS surface. Measurements using current monitoring method show that the electroosmotic mobility of 20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 8) in a PDMS channel is reduced from 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 to 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 (dynamic coating) or 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 (permanent coating)."
