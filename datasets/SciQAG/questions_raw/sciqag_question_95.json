    "Why chlorobenzene was selected as the extraction solvent in this study?": "Chlorobenzene was selected as the extraction solvent because it provided the highest extraction efficiency for aniline and 4-chloroaniline when tested with tetrachlorocarbon as a disperser solvent. It was also less toxic and cheaper than acetone, the other disperser solvent tested."
