    "What are the applications of hierarchical nanostructures in the context of nanoscience and nanotechnology?": "Hierarchical nanostructures, like nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanotubes, are being utilized as building blocks in the production of hierarchical structures for integrated nanosystems. They are also being studied for their novel applications as solar cells and nanogenerators. Moreover, due to their high porosity, they have been also used as photocatalysts and gas sensors."
