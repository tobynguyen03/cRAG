    "What are the potential dangers of aromatic amines according to the paper?": "Aromatic amines, such as aniline and its substituted derivatives, are generally dangerous due to their toxicity and carcinogenicity. They can also be converted into toxic N-nitroso compounds through reactions with nitrosylating agents in the environment. These contaminants may be released as chemical residues of dyestuffs, cosmetics, medicines, and rubber manufacture, and also as by-products of energy technologies such as coal-conversion waste processing."
